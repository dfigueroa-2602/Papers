  abstract = {PV systems are penetrating the energy generation market rapidly and their output strongly depends on environmental conditions. To maximize the energy yield, the utilization of power electronic converters with maximum power tracking function is mandatory. Typically, the dc voltage generated by PV is fed into the ac grid using an dc-ac inverter. On the other hand, most modern loads, from small to large ones, are based on dc. Hence, wide adoption of residential dc microgrids (RDC \textbackslash mu Gs) based on PV energy generation becomes a trend that is following the developments in modern energy-efficient buildings. This paper targets power converters for the integration of PV systems into RDC \textbackslash mu Gs. It considers two main classes: high step-up converters for PV module-level (parallel optimizer) applications and non-isolated buck-boost converters for the PV string (series optimizer) applications. Due to the importance of the PV topic, a significant number of topologies have been introduced in the literature. However, only selected solutions attracted the interest of the industry. This review paper considers PV converters used in the industry or demonstrated in academic publications at a high technology readiness level with comprehensive experimental justification. This allows us to focus this review on the most valuable solutions and to provide a guide for both industry and academic readers. In the end, future trends in industrial PV systems and associated power converters are discussed.},

  abstract = {The converter efficiency defines the overall efficiency of a renewable energy system. In a full power converter, its components process the whole input power, even if it is not mandatory. Partial power processing (PPP) is an exciting concept for improving overall system efficiency and reducing system cost and size. In PPP, the converter processes the amount of power needed to be processed. This work proposes a PPP based on the high-performance Quasi-Z-Source Series Resonance converter (QZSSRC). The proposed partial power converter has a series-input parallel-output (SIPO) architecture. Previous publications in this area mainly consider converters with step-down voltage regulation, like the phase-shifted full-bridge converter. They underperform in this application due to operating at the maximum power when bucking the voltage the most. This paper studies two other types of dc-dc converters, buck-boost and boost, in SIPO partial power converters. Theoretical operation principles are corroborated with full experimental results given and analyzed. A 300 W prototype of the QZSSRC is used to convert the power of up to 2 kW in a PPP system with overall system efficiency over 99\%.},

Processing a percentage of the total power, instead of processing the full power, improves system efficiency and reduces system cost and size. In this paper, an input parallel output series (PISO) buck-boost partial power converter is presented. The first stage of the system is controlled to ensure that PV panels are operating at the maximum power (MP). And the second resonant stage is controlled to fix the dc-bus voltage. Although the system has five-switches, four of them are operating in zero voltage and current switching, to eliminate switching losses of the system. Converter sharing percentage is adjusted to ensure optimum operation of the complete PV system. System analysis and simulation are demonstrated through the manuscript. Experimental and more comparative analysis will be presented in the final version.},

  abstract = {This article presents a computationally efficient and high performing approximate long-horizon model predictive control (MPC) for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). Two continuous control set MPC (CCS-MPC) formulations are considered: the classical current tracking delta MPC (Del-MPC) and the torque tracking economic MPC (EMPC). To achieve offset-free torque tracking under model uncertainties and in all regions of operation, a disturbance observer and a dq-current reference generator are used. To enable real-time implementation of the long-horizon CCS-MPC, the development of a real-time capable solver is not required, since MPC approximation based on deep neural networks (DNNs) is considered and utilized for controller's evaluation at run time. The approximation is done by training the DNN to learn the MPC functionality based on offline-generated training data and in an open-loop manner. The robust and offset-free tracking performance of the proposed DNN-based approximate long-horizon Del-MPC and EMPC has been validated through simulation and real-time implementation at test bench and compared to the state-of-the-art field oriented control (FOC) using internal model controller with field-weakening (FW) part and to the exact short-horizon MPC based on the fast gradient method (FGM-MPC). Results show that the long-horizon MPC can achieve significantly faster torque transient responses in comparison with the short-horizon FGM-MPC and the conventional FOC, especially in FW region.},

  abstract = {As the world grapples with the energy crisis, integrating renewable energy sources into the power grid has become increasingly crucial. Microgrids have emerged as a vital solution to this challenge. However, the reliance on renewable energy sources in microgrids often leads to low inertia. Renewable energy sources interfaced with the network through interlinking converters lack the inertia of conventional synchronous generators, and hence, need to provide frequency support through virtual inertia techniques. This paper presents a new control algorithm that utilizes the reinforcement learning agents Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to support the frequency in low-inertia microgrids. The RL agents are trained using the system-linearized model and then extended to the nonlinear model to reduce the computational burden. The proposed system consists of an AC--DC microgrid comprising a renewable energy source on the DC microgrid, along with constant and resistive loads. On the AC microgrid side, a synchronous generator is utilized to represent the low inertia of the grid, which is accompanied by dynamic and static loads. The model of the system is developed and verified using Matlab/Simulink and the reinforcement learning toolbox. The system performance with the proposed AI-based methods is compared to conventional low-pass and high-pass filter (LPF and HPF) controllers.},

The hierarchical control strategy, consisting of primary and secondary control, is used to regulate HMG. Primary control utilizes droop control for power sharing on AC and DC buses, while secondary control restores AC frequency and DC/AC bus voltages. The ILCs are controlled using hybrid and inverse Q -V droop with low-pass filters (LPFs) to mitigate high-frequency noise, ensuring efficient power exchange between AC and DC sections. The literature review reveals the need for the model development and testing of the parallel-operated ILC in HMG consisting of primary and secondary control. Hence, a linearized small-signal model consisting of primary and secondary control for HMG has been proposed. The model incorporates AC, DC, and ILC dynamics to analyze the power flow and stability of the system. An eigenvalue analysis is performed to assess the impact of the droop coefficients, providing insight into stability enhancement. Time-domain simulations evaluate transient behaviors under disturbances, and the controller hardware-in-loop (CHIL) platform is used to validate the dynamic response. The findings demonstrate the stability of HMG and the critical role of ILCs in enabling power transfer, akin to inter-area tie-lines in conventional systems},

The first control scheme is finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC) with modulation control and the second control scheme is continuous control set-model predictive control (CCS-MPC) with space vector-pulse width modulation. The two schemes adopt the cascaded control approach, which consists of an inner MPC loop for torque control and outer MPC loop for speed control using two individual cost functions. The outer MPC produces the required torque to drive the IM at the reference speed while the reference torque is taken as the input of the inner MPC, which in turn generates control signals for the inverter. The control states of the two MPCs are constrained with the maximum limits of the drive system. The state feedback is achieved with a standard Kalman filter, which estimates the nonmeasured load torque. For a fair comparison, both approaches are applied to the same IM at the same operational circumstances. The control approaches are implemented and validated in an experimental environment using the same sampling frequency on the same test bench (3.7 kW IM drive). The behavior of the control approaches is assessed by applying reference and disturbance steps to the system in different operational modes. Comparison of the predictive schemes leads to the conclusion that the both MPC approaches achieve similar performances. However, the CCS-MPC scheme has a smaller current ripple and is of low computational complexity. The computing duration is not very different for the three tested schemes. CCS-MPC can cope with a less powerful DSP than for FCS.},

  abstract = {Self-governing small regions of power systems, known as ``microgrids'', are enabling the integration of small-scale renewable energy sources (RESs) while improving the reliability and energy efficiency of the electricity network. Microgrids can be primarily classified into three types based on their voltage characteristics and system architecture; 1) AC microgrids, 2) DC microgrids, and 3) Hybrid AC/DC microgrids. This paper presents a comprehensive review of stability, control, power management and fault ride-through (FRT) strategies for the AC, DC, and hybrid AC/DC microgrids. This paper also classifies microgrids in terms of their intended application and summarises the operation requirements stipulated in standards (e.g., IEEE Std. 1547-2018). The control strategies for each microgrid architecture are reviewed in terms of their operating principle and performance. In terms of the hybrid AC/DC microgrids, specific control aspects, such as mode transition and coordinated control between multiple interlinking converters (ILCs) and energy storage system (ESS) are analysed. A case study is also presented on the dynamic performance of a hybrid AC/DC microgrid under different control strategies and dynamic loads. Hybrid AC/DC microgrids shown to have more advantages in terms of economy and efficiency compared with the other microgrid architectures. This review shows that hierarchical control schemes, such as primary, secondary, and tertiary control are very popular among all three microgrid types. It is shown that the hybrid AC/DC microgrids require more complex control strategies for power management and control compared to AC or DC microgrids due to their dependency on the ILC controls and the operation mode of the hybrid AC/DC microgrid. Case study illustrated the significant effects of microgrid feeder characteristics on the dynamic performance of the hybrid AC/DC microgrid. It is also revealed that any transient conditions either in the AC or DC microgrids could propagate through the ILC affecting the entire microgrid dynamic performance. Additionally, the critical control issues and the future research challenges of microgrids are also discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {This article presents a harmonics compensation control scheme for parallel LCC-VSCs interlinking converters (ICs) in a hybrid ac/dc network. The proposed technique addresses the harmonic issue of the LCC unit with higher performance and lower cost by taking advantage of parallel LCC-VSCs configuration. It is important to note that system stability and power quality are fundamental aspects of such a system. The mitigation method is designed for medium/high voltage converters with a low switching frequency, a common environment for the LCC-based units. The harmonics mitigation technique is designed to avoid any interference with the normal operation of the parallel LCC and VSCs in a hybrid ac/dc network. Furthermore, the reactive power consumption issue of the LCCs is also addressed. The proposed system is modelled in detail, and stability studies are conducted. Also, the controlling parameters design procedure is explained thoroughly, assuming proper stability is achieved. The peak current capacity of the VSCs for the anticipated harmonic orders and reactive power compensation is calculated. Eventually, the performance of the proposed control strategy under different operation conditions is investigated. Case study results with MATLAB Simulink and an experimental platform are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

The parallel LCC-VSCs configuration takes advantage of the low cost of the LCC system as well as the bidirectional power flow capability of VSCs and offers an excellent option for lowering system costs with high performance. Moreover, drawbacks of the LCCs such as low power quality, reactive power consumption, and commutation failure can be addressed by using the parallel LCC-VSCs configuration with proper control and coordination. The proposed unified control system is developed by modifying the LCC's V-I graph to create a droop equivalent along with droop-based control of the VSCs. As a result, it provides voltage/frequency support for the AC and voltage support for the DC sub-grids in various operating conditions. In this paper, the performance of the proposed control strategy under different operation conditions is investigated.

The aim is to regulate the output voltage of a Distributed Energy Resource (DER) LC filter to achieve its behavior as a controlled oscillator while complying with the converter's physical limitations. The MPC makes it possible to impose constraints on the state and the input, but at a relatively high computational cost compared with other control methods. Nevertheless, the restrictions applied to the converter modulated voltage and the converter current allow for improving the control performance while achieving a safe response to contingencies. The two alternative solvers, namely Quadprog and Operator splitting solver for quadratic programs (OSQP), are evaluated through simulations to identify efficient alternatives for future real-time embedded implementations. Additionally, a state observer that estimates the DER's output current and input disturbances is included in the control to achieve reference tracking. The electrical simulation software used is PLECS integrated with Matlab/Simulink for implementation of the control. This simulation test bench is used to tune the control parameters, including the horizon, and estimate the potential gain in numerical efficiency achievable using OSQP in embedded control of the application of interest.},

However, the active filter cannot compensate for the neutral current fully, when an already-proposed control strategy based on the modified theory is applied.},

  abstract = {Microgrids (MGs) use renewable sources to meet the growing demand for energy with increasing consumer needs and technological advancement. They operate independently as small-scale energy networks using distributed energy resources. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources and poor power quality are essential operational problems that must be mitigated to improve the MG's performance. To address these challenges, researchers have introduced heuristic optimization mechanisms for MGs. However, local minima and the inability to find a global minimum in heuristic methods create errors in non-linear and nonconvex optimization, posing challenges in dealing with several operational aspects of MG such as energy management optimization, cost-effective dispatch, dependability, storage sizing, cyber-attack minimization, and grid integration. These challenges affect MG's performance by adding complexity to the management of storage capacity, cost minimization, reliability assurance, and balance of renewable sources, which accelerates the need for meta-heuristic optimization algorithms (MHOAs). This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of MHOAs and their role in improving the operational performance of MGs. Firstly, the fundamentals of MG optimization are discussed to explore the scopes, requisites, and opportunities of MHOAs in MG networks. Secondly, several MHOAs in the MG domain are described, and their recent trends in MG's techno-economic analysis, load forecasting, resiliency improvement, control operation, fault diagnosis, and energy management are summarized. The summary reveals that nearly 25\% of the research in these areas utilizes the particle swarm optimization method, while the genetic and grey wolf algorithms are utilized by nearly 10\% and 5\% of the works studied in this paper, respectively, for optimizing the MG's performance. This result summarizes that MHOA presents a system-agnostic optimization approach, offering a new avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of future MGs. Finally, we highlight some challenges that emerge during the integration of MHOAs into MGs, potentially motivating researchers to conduct further studies in this area.},

This leads to reduced efficiency due to increased conduction losses. Consequently, this paper proposes an LLC resonant converter with a wide voltage range based on a reconfigurable voltage rectifier for high-DC bus applications. Owing to the reconfiguration of the rectifier by two active switches, the rectifier can operate in three operation modes--- voltage-doubler rectifier, a voltage-tripler rectifier, and a voltage-quadrupler rectifier. The proposed converter extends its voltage gain by changing the rectifier structure while the switching frequency operates near the resonant frequency. All MOSFET switches are turned on with zero-voltage switching, and all secondary diodes are turned off with zero-current switching. As a result, the performance efficiency is improved compared to that of the conventional LLC converter. A laboratory prototype was designed and experimentally tested to validate the operation and advantages of the proposed converter.},

The topology interfaces two PV panels as power sources by utilizing a dual half-bridge LLC circuit and multi-mode rectifier. In this topology, both PV sources use the same resonant tank for transferring energy to the load. The wide range of the switching frequency change for tracking maximum power point (MPP) of PVs sources reduces the efficiency of the dual-input LLC converter. This paper proposes a multi-mode rectifier on the secondary side of the dual-input LLC to limit the switching frequency change for tracking the MPP of PVs. By configuring a voltage-tripler, voltage-quadrupler, or voltage-fifthfolder rectifier and utilizing frequency modulation, a narrow frequency range and moderate transformer size are realized with an extended output voltage and high efficiency. In addition, soft-switching for primary MOSFETs and rectifier diodes is desired. A dual-input LLC resonant converter with a multi-mode rectifier for 300 W was built and tested. The related measured waveforms are demonstrated to prove the correctness and feasibility of the theoretical analysis.},

This will generate the appropriate gains without the need to know the system.

The development in MVdc depends significantly on the dc--dc converters. Such converters support the modern trends of utilizing medium-frequency transformers in power networks. Research on isolated converters technology is in its infancy and limited by the conversion ratio and component ratings. Besides, there is no standards exist covering specific aspects of isolated converter product. Thus, a review of such converters is needed. This work presents, for the first time, a review of the dc--dc power converter families in MVdc grids, including the leading families that are isolated and nonisolated converters, as well as other subfamilies comparing the specifications and characteristics. Also, the applications of these converters are provided by focusing on the essential requirements for each application.},

  abstract = {Partial shading on series-connected photovoltaic (PV) panels in conventional PV systems results in lower harvested power. To resolve this, it is vital to utilize module level power electronics (MLPE) such as Solar Power Optimizers (SPOs). This paper introduced a non-isolated common ground non-inverting output voltage buck-boost converter as an SPO. Proposed converter benefits from continuous input and output currents which has a significant role in designing SPOs. Having a quadratic gain, beside acceptable step-down range are other features of the converter. Operating principle, design, steady-state, small-signal analysis, and dynamic performance of proposed converter are included. Proposed converter is compared with other buck-boost converters in terms of voltage gain, voltage stresses, continuous input and output current, and output polarity. To validate the performance of introduced converter, experimental results for a prototype with input voltage 24 V, output voltage 72 V for step-up and 15 V for step-down modes are given and results are examined. The maximum efficiency of the prototype is 93\% and 89\% for step-up and step-down modes, respectively. To evaluate the effect of proposed SPO for extracting maximum available power from PVs, simulation results of a grid connected PV system with two series connected SPOs is discussed.},

  abstract = {Three-level neutral-point-clamped (3L-NPC) voltage source inverters are widely used in many low- and medium-power applications. However, the 3L-NPC inverter has an inheritance issue of the neutral-point (NP) voltage unbalancing due to the deviation of dc-link capacitor voltages causing distortions for the output waveform quality. Generally, discontinuous pulsewidth modulation (DPWM) is used to diminish the stress on power transistors and prolong their lifespan, however; it is not capable of solving the issue of NP voltage unbalancing. Therefore, this article proposes a simple voltage balancing control based on DPWM with a hysteresis NP voltage band. The balancing control method is only activated once the capacitance voltage error exceeds the hysteresis band by generating a momentary offset on the opposite direction of the DPWM offset. In this way, both top and bottom capacitance voltages will converge within a predefined error band. Various hysteresis error bands are investigated by analyzing the power losses, total harmonic distortions, and common mode voltage. The advantages of this proposed method are its simplicity and ease of control while maintaining the features of DPWM. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using simulation and experimental results.},

Incorporating FCS-MPC with SMC eliminates the chattering effects in the traditional SMC algorithms. Moreover, incorporating SMC with FCS-MPC enables more robust and stable control performance compared to the conventional FCS-MPC method.

  abstract = {Many scientific, engineering and economic problems involve the optimisation of a set of parameters. These problems include examples like minimising the losses in a power grid by finding the optimal configuration of the components, or training a neural network to recognise images of people's faces. Numerous optimisation algorithms have been proposed to solve these problems, with varying degrees of success. The Particle Swarm Optimiser (PSO) is a relatively new technique that has been empirically shown to perform well on many of these optimisation problems. This thesis presents a theoretical model that can be used to describe the long-term behaviour of the algorithm. An enhanced version of the Particle Swarm Optimiser is constructed and shown to have guaranteed convergence on local minima. This algorithm is extended further, resulting in an algorithm with guaranteed convergence on global minima. A model for constructing cooperative PSO algorithms is developed, resulting in the introduction of two new PSO-based algorithms. Empirical results are presented to support the theoretical properties predicted by the various models, using synthetic benchmark functions to investigate specific properties. The various PSO-based algorithms are then applied to the task of training neural networks, corroborating the results obtained on the synthetic benchmark functions.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new multifunctional converter based on a series voltage compensator applied to centralized AC microgrids. Besides the basic functionalities required for a centralized converter in microgrids, such as grid-supporting and grid-forming voltage support and smooth transition from operating modes, the proposed converter can change its connection topology from series to parallel and vice-versa, depending on the system's condition. Thus, it assumes all the basic defining features of series and shunt power converters. The devised control algorithm allows on-line change of converter operating modes either as voltage- or current-controlled sources. These flexible functionalities allow the converter to operate as: (i) a grid-forming converter providing voltage and frequency references for the entire microgrid, keeping the voltages at the point of common coupling (PCC) synchronized with the utility voltage; (ii) grid-feeding active power into the microgrid; and (iii) gridsupporting, performing ancillary services such as voltage regulation, voltage sag and swell compensation, along with active power filtering, reactive power, unbalance and harmonic compensation. The converter can be applied to both single-phase and three-phase three- or four-wire networks. The multifunctional control is implemented using a Texas Instruments TMS320F28335 digital signal processor, and then validated through a hardware-in-the-loop simulation developed in the Typhoon HIL 600 platform.},

This power acquired from the power optimizer connected with the Solar PV array is then provided to the grid while sustaining the power factor to unity. Moreover, the dc power from the Power optimizer of the microgrid is then provided to PCC (dc bus maintained constant at 600V). The PCC is further connected to a bidirectional converter for charging Electric Vehicles. This bidirectional control of power transfer to the grid with the optimized Solar PV grid connection for eliminating the onboard charger (with AC to DC converter) required for Electric Vehicle charging is validated through MATLAB Simulations.},

Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning (RL) to scale to problems that were previously intractable, such as learning to play video games directly from pixels. DRL algorithms are also applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field of RL, then progress to the main streams of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in deep RL, including the deep Q-network (DQN), trust region policy optimization (TRPO), and asynchronous advantage actor critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via RL. To conclude, we describe several current areas of research within the field.},

  abstract = {Weak grids/microgrids are gaining considerable attention due to the installation of renewable power generation resources in areas that are remote from load centers. This paper presents a multivariable-droop synchronous current converter control strategy for current management of weak grid/microgrid applications, and offers a systematic and straightforward design approach using the loop shaping technique. The controller integrates current regulation, management, and limitation that are applicable to weak grids and microgrids (MGs). The multivariable synchronous current converter enables superior decoupling of d- and q-axis currents in weak grids and/or resistive grids where these control variables are highly coupled due to converter operation at large load-angles. Therefore, stable connection of weak (high impedance) resistive MGs to utility grids is feasible. The multivariable droop concept also realizes real power sharing by simultaneous drooping of both frequency and voltage amplitude, which enhances load sharing accuracy in resistive and/or weak grids. Similar to its predecessor, synchronous converters, the controller can eliminate phase-locked loop (PLL) and provides a unified controller, PLL, and load manager in one simple control methodology. This can facilitate grid auto-synchronization, which can improve the stability of voltage source converters in weak grid applications. Also, the controller can participate in the power system frequency, and voltage regulation and control. To evaluate the performance of the controller, several simulations are conducted under various typical scenarios and conditions.},

  abstract = {Integrating renewable resources in microgrids (MGs) poses a substantial challenge: ensuring stability with low inertia. This paper provides control techniques for the AC frequency and the DC voltage for an isolated/islanded hybrid AC/DC MG using intelligent virtual synchronous generators (VSGs) and intelligent virtual capacitors (VCs). The suggested approaches take advantage of VSG's adaptive damping coefficient and VC's adaptive virtual resistance as defined by intelligent controls. The controllers operate independently, relying solely on local DC voltage and AC frequency measurements without additional communication infrastructure. Compared to the traditional VSG and VC, the hybrid MG with intelligent VSG and VC controls performs better in suppressing AC frequency and DC voltage deviations, regardless of operating mode (rectifier or inverter). Simulation studies in MATLAB/Simulink validate these findings, showing that the artificial neural network (ANN) approach reduces DC voltage deviation by 34.4\% and AC frequency deviation by 26.3\%, while the fuzzy logic control (FLC) approach further reduces these deviations, particularly DC voltage deviation by 41.9\% and AC frequency deviation by 23.2\%. ANN excels in reducing deviations for AC frequency, while FLC is more effective in lowering deviations for DC voltage. The proposed controllers' positive impact on system stability is assessed using small-signal stability analysis.},

  abstract = {The stability of a hybrid AC-DC microgrid depends mainly upon the bidirectional interlinking converter (BIC), which is responsible for power transfer, power balance, voltage solidity, frequency and transients sanity. The varying generation from renewable resources, fluctuating loads, and bidirectional power flow from the utility grid, charging station, super-capacitor, and batteries produce various stability issues on hybrid microgrids, like net active-reactive power flow on the AC-bus, frequency oscillations, total harmonic distortion (THD), and voltage variations. Therefore, the control of BIC between AC and DC buses in grid-connected hybrid microgrid power systems is of great importance for the quality/smooth operation of power flow, power sharing and stability of the whole power system. In literature, various control schemes are suggested, like conventional droop control, communication-based control, model predictive control, etc., each addressing different stability issues of hybrid AC-DC microgrids. However, model dependence, single-point-failure (SPF), communication vulnerability, complex computations, and complicated multilayer structures motivated the authors to develop online adaptive neural network (NN) Q-learning-based full recurrent adaptive neurofuzzy nonlinear control paradigms for BIC in a grid-connected hybrid AC-DC microgrid. The proposed strategies successfully ensure the following: (i) frequency stabilization, (ii) THD reduction, (iii) voltage normalization and (iv) negligible net active-reactive power flow on the AC-bus. Three novel adaptive NN Q-learning-based full recurrent adaptive neurofuzzy nonlinear control paradigms are proposed for PQ-control of BIC in a grid-connected hybrid AC-DC microgrid. The control schemes are based on NN Q-learning and full recurrent adaptive neurofuzzy identifiers. Hybrid adaptive full recurrent Legendre wavelet-based Neural Network Q-learning-based full recurrent adaptive NeuroFuzzy control, Hybrid adaptive full recurrent Mexican hat wavelet-based Neural Network Q-learning-based full recurrent adaptive NeuroFuzzy control, and Hybrid adaptive full recurrent Morlet wavelet-based Neural Network Q-learning-based full recurrent adaptive NeuroFuzzy control are modeled and tested for the control of BIC. The controllers differ from each other, based on variants used in the antecedent part (Gaussian membership function and B-Spline membership function), and consequent part (Legendre wavelet, Mexican hat wavelet, and Morlet wavelet) of the full recurrent adaptive neurofuzzy identifiers. The performance of the proposed control schemes was validated for various quality and stability parameters, using a simulation testbench in MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results were bench-marked against an aPID controller, and each proposed control scheme, for a simulation time of a complete solar day.},

The hybrid microgrid also supports the decentralized grid control structure, aligning with the current scattered and concentrated load scenarios. Hence, there is an increasing need to explore and reveal the integration, optimization, and control strategies regarding the hybrid microgrid.

  abstract = {Converter-based microgrids are modern decentralized energy systems that integrate distributed energy resources, communication networks, and control systems. They manage energy generation, distribution, and utilization to enhance resilience and operational efficiency in modern power networks. Fourth industrial revolution technologies, such as automation, Internet-of-Things, artificial intelligence, and energy storage are integrated to create resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy systems. Model predictive control (MPC) is a promising technique for optimizing microgrid operations by considering system constraints and forecasting disturbances. However, standard MPC implementations struggle with robustness against internal and external uncertainties such as model uncertainties, measurement noise, and cyber threats, making them less effective for real-world microgrid applications. This article provides a comprehensive review of robust MPC techniques designed to enhance the reliability and security of cyber-physical microgrids. The study explores various robust MPC methodologies, including adaptive MPC, observer-based MPC, tube-based MPC, stochastic MPC, and data-driven approaches. The application of these techniques to mitigate uncertainties across different hierarchical levels of microgrid control, in particular, converter and system levels. In addition, this article examines cyber-resilient MPC approaches to mitigate cyber-attacks, including false data injection and denial-of-service attacks. Finally, emerging trends, such as AI-enhanced MPC, digital twin-based testing, and event-driven control, are outlined to support the development of next-generation robust MPC strategies for power converter-based microgrids.},

When both ac microgrids (AC-MGs) and dc microgrids are in the vicinity of each other, they can be interconnected via ac--dc converters, known as ICs, making it possible to exchange energy between two grids. Common methods employed in IC control strategy use frequency variation and CCM in their structure. This method requires the frequency variation at IC ac-side to be large, leading to poor power quality and stability of AC-MG. Furthermore, CCM does not directly regulate the IC ac-side voltage, which again deteriorates the IC ac-side voltage quality. The proposed strategy is based on droop method, similar to what is used in the autonomous control of sources in an AC-MG. This technique uses voltage-controlled method and does not need frequency measurement in its structure. This considerably improves the voltage quality of AC-MG. The derivation of appropriate droop characteristic is explained. Time-domain simulation is used to verify the performance of the proposed method. The small-signal stability of the system is studied. It is shown how by introducing a proper virtual impedance, the small-signal stability of the system can be improved.},

When ac microgrids (AC-MG) and dc microgrids (DC-MG) are present in a distribution grid, there is an opportunity to interconnect them via an interlinking converter (IC) and form a HMG. Power sharing and adequate voltage/frequency control are the main functions of AC-MG and DC-MG control systems in standalone mode. When it comes to a HMG, active power sharing throughout the whole system must also be properly achieved by controlling the IC active power throughput. Furthermore, the possibility of participation of IC in AC-MG reactive power adds some complexity to a HMG control system. In this paper, a new decentralized control strategy is presented for a HMG which relies on regulating the voltage magnitude of a common bus in each microgrid. In this regard, new droop characteristics for sources across both microgrids as well as IC are proposed. The proposed droop characteristics result in better active/reactive power sharing across both microgrids and at the same time results in better voltage regulation. The derivation of new droop characteristics is thoroughly discussed in this paper. Simulation results are used to show the improvement achieved.},

  abstract = {Hybrid AC/DC microgrids (MGs) are comprised of AC and DC MGs interconnected through an interlinking converter (ILC). This paper presents a novel control strategy for double-stage ILCs (consisting of bidirectional DC-DC and DC-AC converters) in islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrids. To provide global power sharing among AC and DC DERs, a PI controller obtains a single relative power reference for the AC and DC DERs based on the energy content of the DC link capacitor. This relative power is then translated into references for the output voltage angular frequency at the AC side of ILC and the output voltage at its DC side, in accordance with the AC and DC DERs' droop characteristics. Then the DC-AC and DC-DC converters realize these references through a voltage-controlled method (VCM) in their inner control loops. Accordingly, the proposed method features grid-forming capability at both AC and DC terminals of ILC, which provides it with some unique advantages. First is the improved resiliency; the system remains stable even if all DC DERs are disconnected or all AC DERs are disconnected. Secondly, stability margin and voltage transients are improved thanks to the PLL-less design and adaptation of VCM. Small-signal stability analysis and hardware-in-the-loop test results demonstrate the stability and dynamic performance of the proposed method not only in normal operation but also under DER disconnection. The results show that the steady-state AC and DC voltage deviations are less than 5\% and the AC voltage undershoot is less than 1V.},

  abstract = {Inverter-based resources (IBRs) are essential for rapid microgrid restoration following blackouts, as they can provide black start services. However, transformer energization during a black start generates a magnetizing inrush that destabilizes the inverter, often leading to failure in grid restoration. This phenomenon represents a significant challenge for the effective deployment of IBRs in black start operations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) approach for inverter-based transformer energization aimed at enabling successful microgrid black start. The paper begins with an analysis of the flux characteristics of the transformer. Then, an autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) model is developed to predict the transformer's magnetizing current. A magnetizing inrush mitigation algorithm is then introduced, combining the ARX model with a classical two-level inverter voltage control strategy. Comparative simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating significant improvements in mitigating magnetizing inrush, achieving fast dynamic responses, and maintaining stable static waveforms.},

  abstract = {With the fast development of energy storage systems, the four-switch buck-boost (FSBB) converter has been widely used because of the bi-directional power flow and wide step-up/down voltage conversion capabilities. With the quadrangle current modulation (QCM) method, the converter can achieve zero voltage switching with a small RMS current. However, the existing QCM approaches impede the wide adoption of FSBB due to their implementation complexity. To address this issue and obtain a simple closed-loop control for output voltage, a real-time simplified four-quadrangle modulation was found without look-up tables or extra current detection. With this simplified control method, the whole control system can be fully implemented in digital controllers. Meanwhile, to aid the compensator design, a small signal model was proposed under QCM operation. The proposed small signal model shows a good agreement with the simulation results in the frequency domain. Finally, a Silicon Carbide (SiC)-based 50kW, 900V input, and 500V-1000V output FSBB converter was built to verify the proposed control scheme and the small-signal model.},

Moreover, high penetration of distributed generation units is redefining the requirements for the design, control and operation of the electric distribution system. A Hybrid Distribution Transformer is a potential cost-effective alternative solution to various distribution grid control devices. The Hybrid Distribution Transformer is realized by augmenting a regular transformer with a fractionally rated power electronic converter, which provides the transformer with additional control capabilities. The Hybrid Distribution Transformer concept can provide dynamic ac voltage regulation, reactive power compensation and, in future designs, form an interface with energy storage devices. Other potential functionalities that can be realized from the Hybrid Distribution Transformer include voltage phase angle control, harmonic compensation and voltage sag compensation. This paper presents the concept of a Hybrid Distribution Transformer and the status of our efforts towards a 500 kVA, 12.47 kV/480 V field demonstrator.},

  abstract = {Hybrid microgrids (HMGs) are attracting increasing interest in the electrical sector, driven by the need to enhance integration between alternating current (ac) and direct current (dc) sources and loads. The rising relevance of these microgrids (MG) originates from their ability to reduce the required conversion units, decreasing the complexity associated with the diverse characteristics of sources and loads. In this context, this study proposes a new topology for a hybrid bidirectional converter designed to serve as an interface between the ac and dc buses of an HMG, with specific applications in low-voltage distribution networks. The converter's ac port is three-phase, including a neutral to enable the use of single-phase loads, and adopts a multilevel approach based on coupled inductors. The use of coupled inductors in the ac port aims primarily at reducing the output current ripple, thereby allowing a decrease in the output filter inductor. In the dc port, the converter shares the same neutral leg as the ac port, resulting in a reduction in the number of semiconductors. The simulation and experimental results validate the performance of the proposed converter, demonstrating a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 3.1\% in voltages and currents.},

However, its widespread use for modeling and analysis of large-scale, general power systems is still a pending issue. One problem that arises when considering dq0 models is that they are typically based on local reference frames, and therefore linking different models is not straightforward. In this paper we propose to approach this problem by modeling the network and its components using a dq0 transformation that is based on a unified reference frame. We demonstrate this idea on the basis of synchronous machines and photovoltaic generators, and we also establish a dq0-based dynamic model of a transmission network. The resulting models all use a unified reference frame, and therefore can be directly linked to each other in simulation and analytically. The paper is accompanied by a free software package (Levron, Y. and Belikov, J.

The agent is trained in the Simulink environment, enriched with Simscape components to enhance the performance. By processing four continuous inputs, i.e. the speed error, its integral, its derivative, and the motor armature current, the agent outputs a PWM signal to control the four H-bridge switches that drive the DC motor. The reward function encourages the agent to learn an optimal control policy that minimizes both the tracking error and the armature current.

The DC microgrid system is a Photovoltaic Generator (PVG) and a battery based energy storage (BES) based system, with constant impedance loads. The purpose of the DC microgrid is to manage the power within the DC system and to provide the necessary inertial support to the AC system. For the control of the interlinking voltage source inverter, a DC link voltage based virtual inertia strategy is formulated, which is formed as a lead-lag compensator with the change in the DC link voltage as the input, and the frequency as the output. The proposed method serves a two-fold advantage as a unified controller, i.e., the requisite inertial response is provided, as the compensator is the outcome of the swing equation, and the same controller can act as a bus signalling control, therefore managing the power flow to the utility in the grid connected mode of operation. Time domain analysis of the microgrid system verifies the efficacy of the proposed approach for both power flow based on utility command, as well as inertial support in the isolated mode. The compensator tuning is achieved with the help of a small signal analysis of the cascaded inertial controller deployed.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a secondary voltage control of microgrids based on the distributed cooperative control of multi-agent systems. The proposed secondary control is fully distributed; each distributed generator only requires its own information and the information of some neighbors. The distributed structure obviates the requirements for a central controller and complex communication network which, in turn, improves the system reliability. Input-output feedback linearization is used to convert the secondary voltage control to a linear second-order tracker synchronization problem. The control parameters can be tuned to obtain a desired response speed. The effectiveness of the proposed control methodology is verified by the simulation of a microgrid test system.},

Considering the existence of alternating current (ac) loads and sources and concerning increasing direct current (dc) loads and sources, hybrid ac/dc MGs have been used to have the advantages of both ac and dc MGs and reduce the drawbacks of them. By integrating the DG units in hybrid ac/dc MGs. Hence, a proper control method is required in such MGs to achieve precise voltage regulation and power-sharing, desired power quality, high efficiency, and high reliability. This article focused on nonlinear exponential control and distributed secondary control schemes to properly control the MG and form an integrated nonlinear hierarchical control and management for hybrid ac/dc MGs. Finally, to evaluate the proposed nonlinear control strategy's performance, offline digital time-domain simulation studies are carried out on a test MG system in MATLAB/Simulink environment. The results are also compared with previously reported methods. The simulation results and the comparisons showed that the proposed methods could properly share the power among subgrids and DGs in both ac and dc subgrids. In contrast, the proposed control scheme can prove its effectiveness and superiority over conventional controllers.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a frequency-adaptive current control design for a grid-connected inverter with an inductive--capacitive--inductive (LCL) filter to overcome the issues relating to both the harmonic distortion and frequency variation in the grid voltage. The current control scheme consists of full-state feedback control to stabilize the system and integral control terms to track the reference in the presence of disturbance and uncertainty. In addition, the current controller is augmented with resonant control terms to mitigate the harmonic component. The control scheme is implemented in the synchronous reference frame (SRF) to effectively compensate two harmonic orders at the same time by using only one resonant term. Moreover, to tackle the frequency variation issue in grid voltage, the frequency information which is extracted from the phase-locked loop (PLL) block is processed by a moving average filter (MAF) for the purpose of eliminating the frequency fluctuation caused by the harmonically distorted grid voltage. The filtered frequency information is employed to synthesize the resonant controller, even in the environment of frequency variation. To implement full-state feedback control for a grid-connected inverter with an LCL filter, all the state variables should be available. However, the increase in number of sensing devices leads to the rise of cost and complexity for hardware implementation. To overcome this challenge, a discrete-time full-state current observer is introduced to estimate all the system states. When the grid frequency is subject to variation, the discrete-time implementation of the observer in the SRF requires an online discretization process because the system matrix in the SRF includes frequency information. This results in a heavy computational burden for the controller. To resolve such a difficulty, a discrete-time observer in the stationary reference frame is employed in the proposed scheme. In the stationary frame, the discretization of the system model can be accomplished with a simple offline method even in the presence of frequency variation since the system matrix does not include the frequency. To select desirable gains for the full-state feedback controller and full-state observer, an optimal linear quadratic control approach is applied. To validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed frequency-adaptive control, simulation and experimental results are presented.},

  abstract = {Renewable energy sources like wind, sun, and hydro are seen as a reliable alternative to the traditional energy sources such as oil, natural gas, or coal. Distributed power generation systems (DPGSs) based on renewable energy sources experience a large development worldwide, with Germany, Denmark, Japan, and USA as leaders in the development in this field. Due to the increasing number of DPGSs connected to the utility network, new and stricter standards in respect to power quality, safe running, and islanding protection are issued. As a consequence, the control of distributed generation systems should be improved to meet the requirements for grid interconnection. This paper gives an overview of the structures for the DPGS based on fuel cell, photovoltaic, and wind turbines. In addition, control structures of the grid-side converter are presented, and the possibility of compensation for low-order harmonics is also discussed. Moreover, control strategies when running on grid faults are treated. This paper ends up with an overview of synchronization methods and a discussion about their importance in the control},

The modern power grid requires flexible energy utilization but presents challenges in the case of a high penetration degree of renewable energy, among which wind and solar photovoltaics are typical sources. The integration level of the DPGS into the grid plays a critical role in developing sustainable and resilient power systems, especially with highly intermittent renewable energy resources. To address the challenging issues and, more importantly, to leverage the energy generation, stringent demands from both utility operators and consumers have been imposed on the DPGS. Furthermore, as the core of energy conversion, numerous power electronic converters employing advanced control techniques have been developed for the DPGS to consolidate the integration. In light of the above, this paper reviews the power-conversion and control technologies used for DPGSs. The impacts of the DPGS on the distributed grid are also examined, and more importantly, strategies for enhancing the connection and protection of the DPGS are discussed.},

A factor-variable k/sub 0/ (proportional to the time of application of vector V/sub 7/) was introduced. By changing k/sub 0/ from zero to one, the duration of application of V/sub 7/ can be changed from 0\% to 100\% of the combined application time for zero-state vectors. Correlation between modified space-vector and triangle-comparison methods (with added zero sequence) was established. The influence of factor k/sub 0/ on characteristics of the PWM was investigated. An expression for the optimal value of k/sub 0/ that provides minimum ripple in the load current was derived. Salient features of the new algorithm are extended linearity (up to a modulation index of 1.154), reduced switching losses, and ability to change the current spectrum by changing k/sub 0/ every sampling time. The developed algorithm is suitable for microprocessor and analog implementation. Since the new algorithm combines the theory of space-vector PWM with the ease of implementation of a triangle-comparison PWM, it is named "hybrid" PWM (HPWM).},

The typical cascade structure of FOC algorithms, for instance, can be avoided by implementing a single controller that manages both speed and currents. The innovation proposed within this paper is the application of Model Predictive Control to an IPM synchronous motor drive. Herein, special attention is given to the system's non-linearities and how the controller can be modified to realize flux-weakening and other control strategies.

  abstract = {Control of multi-phase machines is a challenging topic due to the high number of controlled variables. Conventional control methods, such as field-oriented control (FOC), address this issue by introducing more control loops. This, however, increases the controller design complexity, while the tuning process can become cumbersome. To tackle the above, this paper proposes a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm based controller that fulfills all the control objectives in one computational stage. More specifically, the proposed approach aims to learn a suitable current control policy for six-phase permanent magnet synchronous machines to simplify the commissioning of the drive system. In doing so, physical limitations of the drive system can be accounted for, while the compensation of imbalances between the two three-phase subsystems is rendered possible. After validating the training results in a controller-in-the-loop environment, test bench measurements are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. As shown, favorable steady-state and dynamic performance is achieved that is comparable to that of FOC. Therefore, as indicated by the presented results, reinforcement learning-based control approaches for multi-phase machines is a promising research area.},

Specifically, given a finite collection of disturbance realizations drawn from a generic distribution, we consider the problem of designing a stabilizing control policy with provable safety and performance guarantees despite the mismatch between the empirical and true distributions. We capture this discrepancy using Wasserstein ambiguity sets, and we formulate a distributionally robust (DR) optimal control problem, which provides guarantees on the expected cost, safety, and stability of the system. To solve this problem, we first present new results for Wasserstein DR optimization of quadratic objectives with additional bounded support constraints, showing that strong duality holds under mild conditions. Then, by combining our results with the system-level parametrization of linear feedback policies, we show that the design problem can be reduced to a semidefinite program. We present numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of our approach and to highlight the value of centering the ambiguity set at the empirical distribution for control design.},

The power system consists of three voltage source inverters with different power ratings connected in parallel to the AC bus. Moreover, two DC/DC converters are connected to the DC bus. An interlinking converter (ILC) is used to achieve bidirectional power flow between the AC and DC buses. A virtual impedance-based droop controller is implemented achieve an accurate power-sharing between the inverters connected to the AC bus and a smooth transition between grid-connected and island modes. The main motivation behind the use of the virtual impedance is to overcome the problem caused by the mismatch of inverters' impedances.

  abstract = {Performance degradation is, in general, regarded as a power quality problem. One solution to recover grid performance is through the application of a unified power quality conditioner (UPQC). Although these devices are multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) systems, the most common control strategies consist of two decoupled controllers, which neglect the coupling effects and add uncertainty to the system. For this reason, this paper proposes a multivariable resonant observer-based control strategy of a UPQC system. This method includes all significant coupling effects between this system and the grid. This strategy results in a stability-based compensator, which differs from recently proposed strategies that are based on signal calculation and cannot assure closed-loop stability. In addition, this paper introduces a simplified controller tuning strategy based on optimal conventional methods without losing closed-loop performance. It implies that the controller can be easily tuned, despite the complexity of the MIMO dynamic model. The UPQC with the resonant observer is verified on an experimental setup for a single-phase system, obtaining three relevant results for power quality improvement: (1) harmonics compensation tested with a total harmonic distortion limit of 5\%; (2) sags and swells mitigation; and (3) power factor correction, achieving a unitary value on the grid side.},

Particularly, three-phase PWM voltage-source and current-source rectifiers are thoroughly studied using the graphical capabilities of this approach, namely, complex signal flow graphs. These are used to directly and intuitively derive high-performance nonlinear control laws based on input-output feedback linearization. Specifically, a cascaded and a paralleled control scheme are investigated for the voltage-source rectifier, whereas a cascaded scheme is considered for the current-source rectifier. Under these strategies both converters exhibit linear and decoupled d-q axes dynamics, while also attaining a reactive power compensation capacity. Moreover, linearization of their respective dc-link voltage and current loops utterly enforces and ensures their operating stability. All this is achieved without the elaborate mathematical complexity of input-output linearization, effectively shunned out by the proposed complex state-space approach. Finally, experimental results from 5-kVA digital-signal-processor-based laboratory prototypes verify the analysis and downright performance evinced by these AFE converters.},

Advantages such as the simple operational principle, fast dynamic response, multivariable control, among others, have contributed to establishing Model Predictive Control (MPC) as a suitable alternative for controlling the inverter systems with LCL filters. However, it presents a significant disadvantage: it relies on the phenomenological model of the system, thus disturbances or random variations in parameters deteriorate control quality and performance. This work proposes the implementation of a model-free voltage predictive control for a grid-forming inverter with LCL filter, based on an ultralocal predictor using only input and output data from the system. The proposed method is validated through simulation analysis and experimental results to demonstrate its real-time applicability.},

Consisting of a low-frequency transformer and a fractionally rated power electronic converter, hybrid transformers (HTs) can be applied to ensure a high power quality by controlling voltage, active and reactive power dynamically. For the application in conventional grids, HTs have to withstand considerable overvoltages and overcurrents during voltage surges or short circuits. Although HTs recently gained increasing research interest, protection requirements and protection concepts have not been discussed yet. These aspects are, however, essential to evaluate the practical potential of HTs. In this article, protection requirements are derived and a protection concept is developed and verified by simulations and experiments for a 100-kVA hybrid distribution transformer. Although the protection concept has a considerable impact on the design and performance of the converter, it increases the total losses and volume of the HT only insignificantly. An efficiency of 98.48\% is achievable for an HT including protection, which is only slightly lower than the efficiency of 98.64\% for a comparable conventional transformer. This renders the HT a promising solution for today's and future ac grids.},

  abstract = {The increasing penetration of nonlinear loads (NLLs) and distributed energy resources (DERs) in low-voltage grids poses challenges to power quality and grid hosting capacity (GHC). This article proposes a centralized multimode selective power control strategy for grid-connected ac microgrids (MGs) that does not require prior knowledge of MG parameters. The strategy enhances GHC and power quality across multiple MG nodes through coordinated control in two nonsimultaneous modes. In the centralized mode, a generalized power-based control algorithm enables selective harmonic/distortion power dispatch. This formulation improves disturbance rejection and accuracy in point of common coupling (PCC) power tracking. For the first time, feedback, feedforward, and disturbance decoupling actions are applied to distortion/harmonic power in MGs. In the decentralized mode, harmonic current compensation (HCC) is achieved without communication links, reducing data traffic via a selective voltage-detection-based approach. The proposed strategy enables (i) resistive load synthesis at the PCC to damp upstream grid resonances, (ii) sinusoidal current synthesis (SCS) for current quality enhancement and compliance with standards, and (iii) HCC based on voltage measurements to improve voltage quality at internal nodes. Comprehensive simulations evaluate reference tracking, disturbance rejection, grid short-circuit level effects, and mode transitions. Results show that in decentralized mode, PCC voltage THD improved from 10.65\% to 1.09\% under weak grids. In centralized mode, with SCS up to the 11th harmonic, PCC current THD was reduced from 61.18\% to 3.42\% under stiff grids. Experimental results confirm the feasibility of implementation in real MGs.},

By considering the unfavorable factors as control disturbances, the LADRC control method is able to obtain ideal performance through utilizing linear error state feedback (LESF) and dynamic disturbances compensation. In addition, in order to reduce DC link voltage fluctuation and eliminate double frequency ripple, a super capacitor is connected to DC link through a bidirectional DC/DC converter. By controlling the PWM signal of converter, the DC link capacitor can be charged or discharged to keep its voltage stable.

The MC may be considered more reliable and is smaller because the bulky dc capacitor is eliminated from the topology. Therefore, when MCs are used in ac-ac power conversion, the size and weight of the whole generation system is reduced. To interface a MC-based generation system to an unbalanced three-phase stand-alone load, a four-leg MC is required to provide an electrical path for the zero-sequence load current. Moreover, to compensate for the voltage drops in the output filter inductances, nonlinearities introduced by the four-step commutation method and voltage drops in the semiconductor devices, closed-loop regulation of the load voltage is required. In this paper, the design and implementation of a resonant control system for four-leg MCs is presented. The application of this control methodology when the four-leg MC is feeding, a linear/nonlinear unbalanced load is also presented in this study. High-order resonant controllers are also analyzed.

This issue becomes particularly relevant when considering embedded applications, such as the control of synchronous motor drives, characterized by challenging real-time constraints. This work proposes a systematic approach for dramatically reducing the complexity of such algorithms. Such methodology enables real-time feasibility of the constrained version of this control structure, which was previously precluded. Simulations and experimental results are provided to validate the method, considering the current control of an interior permanent magnet motor as test-case.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control represents a quite mature technology for current control of electric drives. Continuous control set MPC has been widely investigated for the current loop of permanent magnet synchronous motor. Standard PI controllers are often preferred for the speed loop. An innovative speed and current cascade model predictive control architecture for synchronous motor drives is proposed in this paper, to comply with the different requirements of the two loops. Parameter uncertainties represent a critical issue in the implementation of predictive controllers. Considering continuous control set MPC, these mismatches induce bias errors in the desired reference tracking. On one hand, a MPC with intrinsic integral action is adopted in the current loop. The integral action avoids the error induced by electric parameters uncertainties. On the other hand, a separate continuous control set MPC is adopted for the speed loop. A moving horizon estimator supports the latter MPC algorithm, compensating mismatches in the mechanical model of the system. This estimator is used, for instance, to compensate external loading torques. The proposed architecture is validated through experiments on an interior permanent magnet motor. Performances of the proposed solution are compared to the ones obtained using a cascade of PI controllers. Robustness of the architecture against mechanical and electric model uncertainties is investigated too.},

  abstract = {Hybrid Distribution Transformers (HDTs) have been proposed as an alternative to conventional distribution transformers and Solid-State Transformers (SSTs), combining in a single solution a conventional Low-Frequency Transformer (LFT) with one or more power converter stages. Nonetheless, some HDT configurations exhibit a Circulating Active Power Flow (CAPF) while compensating for grid voltage disturbances. The CAPF increases the amount of power processed by the power converters, leading to reduced efficiency. The CAPF can be eliminated if the energy required to compensate for grid voltage disturbances is supplied by a DC source, such as a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). Another alternative is to connect the DC stage of the HDT to a DC microgrid. In the context of a hybrid microgrid, the HDT can operate as an interlinking converter between both grids. The parallel-connected converter can manage energy flow between the AC and DC microgrids, while the seriesconnected converter can supply precise voltage regulation to the low-voltage AC grid. This work presents the model and control of an Interlinking Hybrid Distribution Transformer (IHDT) for a hybrid microgrid. A simple adaptive gain is employed to account for the distribution of the CAPF.},

In this scenario, effects such as high-amplitude grid voltage variations are expected due to the highly variable penetration of renewable energy systems, as well as voltage and current harmonics due to the nonlinear loads. The Hybrid Distribution Transformer (HDT) has been proposed as a solution to solve future grid problems, combining a conventional transformer with a power converter stage. Typically, the series converter is integrated into the medium or low-voltage grid through coupling transformers or by an additional winding of the main transformer, increasing the weight and volume of the solution. Therefore, this work proposed an HDT in which the series converter is directly connected to the medium voltage windings of the distribution transformer, operating at low current levels. The galvanic isolation is delivered by an intermediate isolated DC/DC stage based on Dual-Active Bridge (DAB) converters. The model and control of the proposed HDT are presented and confirmed by simulation results.},

  abstract = {Distribution systems are under constant stress due to their highly variable operating conditions, which jeopardize distribution transformers and lines, degrading the end-user service. Due to transformer regulation, variable loads can generate voltage profiles out of the acceptable bands recommended by grid codes, affecting the quality of service. At the same time, nonlinear loads, such as diode bridge rectifiers without power factor correction systems, generate nonlinear currents that affect the distribution transformer operation, reducing its lifetime. Variable loads can be commonly found at domiciliary levels due to the random operation of home appliances, but recently also due to electric vehicle charging stations, where the distribution transformer can cyclically vary between no-load, rated and overrated load. Thus, the distribution transformer can not safely operate under highly-dynamic and stressful conditions, requiring the support of alternative systems. Among the existing solutions, hybrid transformers, which are composed of a conventional transformer and a power converter, are an interesting alternative to cope with several power quality problems.

Among the available HDT configurations, the one that connects a series/parallel converter on the primary/secondary side can be highlighted. This configuration improves the voltage and current waveforms on the transformer and regulates the voltage supplied to the ac microgrid. Nonetheless, this HDT suffers from a circulating active power flow (CAPF), affecting its efficiency. Moreover, during the unbalanced operation of the HDT, an additional CAPF component exists. Depending on the grid and load conditions and whether the parallel converter compensates for the load unbalances, the CAPF can either increase or decrease. Although the CAPF can be eliminated by employing the dc port of the HDT, it is not always possible to extract energy from it. This work contributes with the analysis of the operation of an HDT under an unbalanced grid voltage and load, along with an extended CAPF model that considers the losses of the HDT. The effect of the unbalanced components on the CAPF is analyzed, and the conditions in which the CAPF is minimized are obtained. Nonetheless, in most scenarios, a minimum CAPF does not coincide with the maximum efficiency of the HDT. Therefore, the conditions for achieving maximum efficiency are also determined. A simpler suboptimal condition is obtained due to the complexity of requiring precise parameters and operating conditions of the HDT. Moreover, the suboptimal condition allows for improving the power quality of the HDT. Therefore, a certain amount of CAPF is desired to operate the HDT properly.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a power management strategy (PMS) that improves the power quality in a hybrid AC/DC microgrid with an energy storage system (ESS) applying a modified interlinking converters topology. To create the DC microgrid, an interlinking converter (ILC) operates as a grid-forming unit. Moreover, other interfacing device is employed, consisting of a bidirectional DC-DC half-bridge converter coupled with a voltage source converter (VSC). The energy storage device (ESD) is connected to the DC bus between the two converter stages. Such modified topology is called Two Stages Interlinking Converter with Energy Storage Device (TSILC-ESD). The PMS applied in the hybrid AC/DC microgrid is based on the ILC control responsible for the DC microgrid formation, and the TSILC-ESD control, which provides ancillary services to the utility grid. Therefore, the electric current's harmonic specter injected into the utility grid is mitigated at the point of common coupling (PCC). Besides, a droop-based power-sharing between the ESD and the power grid is implemented, aiming to achieve voltage regulation in the DC link. Different source and load profiles are considered to analyze both sub-grids' proposed strategy to explore the modified interlinking converters in different operation conditions. Simulations are carried out in the MatLab/Simulink software. The results show that the interlink converter improves the flexibility of the hybrid microgrid and, in addition, the power quality of the energy supplied in the utility grid is improved.},

  abstract = {Thanks to the push towards sustainable energy, modern electric networks are witnessing the spread of photovoltaic and wind renewable sources, which are the main responsible for the great and great diffusion of converter-interfaced distributed generators. The number of these converter-interfaced sources is increasing at such a level that it is having a significant impact on the stability and operation of the electric grids. This raises the issue of properly integrating power converters for energy-source interface into the electric grid, so that they can concur to its stable and performing control. The very rich scientific production testifies that such a question is greatly attracting the attention of the international scientific community. Grid-connected converters interfacing distributed generators are classified according to their operation and performed task, but the scientific literature has not still provided a unique classification. This paper makes an overview of the two main classifications used in the literature, highlighting the peculiarities of the two classifications, their similarities and differences, and describing the different categories of converters, their tasks, up to date control strategies and solutions for the most important issues found in the recent literature. Moreover, in the attempt of providing a merge between the two classifications and avoid confusion about~the concept of ``grid forming'', used with different meaning by both the classifications, a new nomenclature for converter categories is proposed. Given that most of research lines try to conform the new concepts to the traditional ones, focus is posed on the distributed generators with traditional non-communication based primary control.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a new method for minimizing the transients in the output of a DC-DC converter required for small powered portable electronic applications. The transient problem has been the most serious problem for power supplies needing the output voltage in the mid-range of the input voltage. The maximum transient arises when the input voltage becomes almost equal to the output voltage. Selecting the best approach involves a tradeoff among cost, efficiency, and output noise or ripple. There are various techniques used to solve the problem of transients. However, most of the methods have drawbacks such as comparatively higher transients or lower efficiency because of the longer switching operations. This paper describes few methods already been used to solve the transient problem and points out the demerits of those methods. In addition, a new combination method, which combines buck and boost modes during the transition mode, is described in this paper to minimize the transients at the output of the converters when the input voltage is near to the output voltage. Mathematical equations have been put forward to support the proposed idea for the transient minimization. Simulation results have been added to make a comparative analysis of transient response of this method with respect to the other methods},

This scheme is suitable for control of inverters in distributed source environments such as in isolated AC systems, large and distributed uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems, photovoltaic systems connected to AC grids, and low-voltage DC power transmission meshes. A key feature of the control scheme is that it uses feedback of only those variables that can be measured locally at the inverter and does not need communication of control signals between the inverters. This is essential for the operation of large AC systems, where distances between inverters make communication impractical. It is also important in high-reliability UPS systems where system operation can be maintained in the face of a communication breakdown. Real and reactive power sharing between inverters can be achieved by controlling two independent quantities: the power angle and the fundamental inverter voltage magnitude.

For conventional secondary control methods of DGs, communication lines of DGs and inter-domain communication lines between DGs and ICs are utilized to achieve the objectives, raising reliability and cost issues. In this study, a novel decentralized secondary control method for DGs in an IHMG is proposed, eliminating the need for communications of DGs and inter-domain communications.

For reliable operation of an IHMG, achieving distributed generators' power sharing (DGPS) throughout the entire IHMG and ICs' power sharing (IPS) is the main objective in an IHMG. To improve efficiency of an IHMG, minimizing operating costs of DGs is required and thus cost-minimized DGPS needs to be achieved. Similarly, when multiple ICs operate in an IHMG, efficiency-maximized IPS can further improve the efficiency of an IHMG, as total loss of ICs can vary by the IPS ratios. Thus, this paper proposes a distributed power sharing strategy to achieve cost-minimized DGPS and efficiency-maximized IPS simultaneously, without any communication lines for DGs. Incremental cost-based droop controlled DGs and distributed controlled ICs are coordinated for cost-minimized DGPS and a distributed optimal power sharing method of ICs is proposed to achieve efficiency-maximized IPS. The proposed strategy secures both cost-minimized DGPS and efficiency-maximized IPS, with only sparse communication lines among ICs, thus resulting in a significant improvement in IHMG efficiency and reliability.},

Compared with other CBPWM schemes, the CBPWM with the proposed method has lower computation cost, does not need the information of the three-phase currents, and can reduce the switching loss of the NPC inverter. The CBPWM with the proposed zero-sequence voltage injection method and its superiority is validated experimentally in comparison with existing CBPWM schemes.

This study applies the feedback linearized method and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) method using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to analysis and stabilize the highly nonlinear quadrotor system without applying any nonlinear function approximator that includes neural network approach and fuzzy approach. The article proposes a new method based on the firstly proposed convergence rate formula to achieve the optimal weighting matrices of LQR such that the composite controller can reduce the amplitudes of system control inputs. Determination of the LQR tuning parameters is conventionally achieved via trial and error approach. In addition to being very troublesome, it is difficult to find the globally best tuning matrices with LQR method. This article firstly uses the convergence rate formula of the nonlinear system as the fitness function of LQR approach by using PSO to take the place of the trial and error method. The generalities and implications of proposed approach are globally valid, whereas the Jacobian linearized approach is locally valid due to the Taylor expansion theorem. In addition to these two major achievements, the significant innovation of the proposed method is to possess ``simultaneously'' additional performances including the almost disturbance decoupling, input amplitude reduction, tuning parameter optimization and globally exponential stability performances. Comparative examples show that the convergence rate with our proposed optimal controller using the PSO algorithm is larger than the fuzzy method, and better than the singular perturbation method with high-gain feedback.},

  abstract = {A novel DC/DC conversion architecture is proposed for a non-isolated front-end bus converter with wide input voltage range. A DC-DCX, which operates as a DC-DC converter with regulated output or as a DC-DC transformer with unregulated output, is adopted in the bus converter to provide an optimized intermediate DC-bus voltage for the down-stream converters. The input and output of the DC-DCX are in-series and connected to the total-input voltage. Therefore, part of the total input power is directly transferred to the intermediate bus without conversion, and the voltage and current stresses of the DC-DCX can be reduced. The DC-DCX is implemented with a synchronous-rectification LLC resonant converter. A hybrid synchronous driving scheme is presented for the LLC to further improve the conversion efficiency. In order to emphasize the superiority of the proposed driving scheme, the comparisons between the traditional and the newly proposed synchronous driving scheme are presented in this paper. Finally, a 36V{$\sim$}72V input, 10V{$\sim$}14V output and 100W-rated prototype is built and tested to verify the analysis, also help to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.},

The MR-MIMO architecture couples a large number of modular dc--ac cells with a single magnetic core which processes multiway bidirectional power flow. The system voltage and current ratings can be linearly extended and reconfigured by connecting the dc--ac cells in series or parallel. The MR-MIMO architecture decouples the voltage rating and current rating of the basic cells, and offers much lower device stress than traditional wide-operation range multiport dc--dc converters. The key contributions of this article include: 1) a multicell reconfigurable 12-winding MIMO converter with high performance across a wide range; 2) a hybrid time-sharing and phase-shift control strategy; and 3) a systematic method of designing multiwinding PCB transformers. The MR-MIMO architecture allows one power converter being used for multiple purposes through software reconfiguration. The work presented in this article proved that it is possible to gain significantly design flexibility in a multicell reconfigurable architecture without sacrificing the efficiency or power density. A 500-W 4-port energy router with 12 modular cells and a 12-winding transformer has been built and tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MR-MIMO architecture. The energy router maintains over 95\% efficiency across a wide range of input and output voltage options.},

Power converters are the key system component to interface distributed generation systems to the electrical power grid and are increasingly required to provide grid supporting measures to an extent comparable to classical centralized power stations. Thus, improving the control performance of power converters in microgrids is becoming more significant. This work proposes an optimal voltage control strategy for a grid-feeding active-front-end power converter, which inherently regulates its bus voltage within a defined tolerance band while simultaneously keeping the provided reactive power at a specified optimal level. The focus is put on the proposed multi-loop control which incorporates a fast model predictive based current controller. Simulations and experiments on a power converter test bench are presented to validate the performance of the proposed voltage regulation scheme. The controller implementation is carried out for a three-level neutral-point-clamped voltage source inverter with an LCL output filter. Based on the results of the experimental validation, a simulation-based case study demonstrates its performance for multiple grid-tied power converters in an AC microgrid.},

Microgrids consist of multiple distributed generators (DGs) that are usually integrated via power electronic inverters. In order to enhance power quality and power distribution reliability, microgrids need to operate in both grid-connected and island modes. Consequently, microgrids can suffer performance degradation as the operating conditions vary due to abrupt mode changes and variations in bus voltages and system frequency. This paper presents controller design and optimization methods to stably coordinate multiple inverter-interfaced DGs and to robustly control individual interface inverters against voltage and frequency disturbances. Droop-control concepts are used as system-level multiple DG coordination controllers, and control theory is applied to device-level inverter controllers. Optimal control parameters are obtained by particle-swarm-optimization algorithms, and the control performance is verified via simulation studies.},

A significant challenge in the design of the weighting factors within the MPC is that inappropriate selections can adversely affect the system's performance, given their direct impact on the cost function. The methodology presented aims to simplify the design of the weighting factors in the MPC applied to the DFIG using the root locus method (RLM), based on ensuring the stability of closed-loop eigenvalues while optimizing performance related to power regulation and energy quality.

The proposed methodology is exemplified for a three-phase current-controlled voltage source inverter. As examples of stabilizing control strategies, multisampled pulse-width modulation and active damping impedance-emulation are shown to be capable of rendering all passivity properties non-negative at high frequencies.

  abstract = {Presently, there is huge development in conventional power systems due to the evolution of modern smart grids, wherein interconnected microgrids with a high level of energy storage and renewable energy penetration are gaining popularity in the modern distribution network. Future electrical distribution systems, or even transmission structures that combine AC and DC sources and loads are thought to be most promising when it comes to hybrid AC-DC systems. Using a combined operation of both AC and DC microgrids through an interfacing converter, hybrid AC-DC microgrids are advanced and benefitted with the use of both AC and DC topologies. Power management techniques for these microgrids are among the most important operational aspects. This paper provides a systematic review on numerous schemes to control hybrid AC-DC microgrids. Basically, microgrid control strategies are categorized as local control and coordinated control. Coordinated control is further divided in three control strategies as, distributed, centralized, and decentralized control. All these control strategies are employed to satisfy many control objectives, like bus voltage and frequency regulation, power sharing, and management, power quality, stability and reliability improvement, energy management, and economic dispatch. In this paper, various aspects associated with these control objectives and limitations in their control strategies are discussed. Also, future prospects on control of hybrid AC-DC microgrids and an effective and robust control strategy for power management possibly to be employed, are presented in the concluding section of this paper.},

Various topologies and control schemes have been documented aiming at reducing the cost and improving the performance of the compensation system. Hybrid active filters inherit the efficiency of passive filters and the improved performance of active filters, and thus constitute a viable improved approach for harmonic compensation. In this paper a parallel hybrid filter is studied for current harmonic compensation. The hybrid filter is formed by a single tuned LC filter per phase and a small-rated power three-phase active filter, which are directly connected in series without any matching transformer. The required rating of the active filter is much smaller than a conventional standalone active filter would be. No additional switching-ripple filter is required for the hybrid filter because the LC filter functions not only as a harmonic filter but also as a switching-ripple filter around 10 kHz. Simulation results and experimental results obtained in laboratory confirmed the validity and effectiveness of the control},

Using module-level converters at the output of the PV panels adds a constant loss even when there is no power mismatch, which increases the overall system losses and compromises part of the energy yield improvement. To decrease this constant loss especially when there is no power mismatch, partial power processing (PPP) concept is used in this article to achieve a new high-frequency and high-efficiency module-integrated PV converter, which can achieve full range MPPT and maximum possible efficiency when there is no mismatch. To overcome the challenge of limited MPPT range for partial power converters, a special pulse density modulation technique is proposed, which preserves the merits of PPP and renders full range MPPT. A 220-W prototype converter is implemented to justify the converter principal of operation and analyses. The proposed converter reached 99.6\%--96.5\% efficiency for the power mismatches in the PV module ranging from 0\% to 50\% of the maximum module power generation capability, respectively. The efficiency drop is shown to be linear with power mismatch level without any abrupt reductions that is commonly observed in conventional PV module-integrated converters.},

In photovoltaic systems without transformers, fluctuations in CMV lead to a flow of leakage current and high-frequency harmonics. Using a limited number of switching states may reduce the leakage current. The cost of this act is the deterioration of the current quality. Model predictive control, reinforced by the virtual voltage concept, is useful for compensating for this drawback without needing system linearization. However, the computational burden of the processor will increase. To overcome this issue, this research proposes a remote state deadbeat technique. A cost function is defined to choose the optimal voltage vector from among ten candidate voltage vectors. This method reduces both line current distortion and the leakage current. Also, the computational burden is almost similar to that of the remote state predictive method.},

The proposed strategy, devised by classic and modified droop-based controllers, allows control of the microgrid active power relating to the system frequency, while regulating the reactive power related to the voltage, dispensing any need for communication infrastructures. Beyond ensuring proper microgrid power balance at all times, the control strategy prioritizes energy extraction from non-dispatchable sources (i.e., photovoltaic-based systems), whereas it uses dispatchable sources (i.e., battery-based systems) to share active and reactive power proportionally to their capabilities. As a consequence of the proper and novel management of battery-based converters, battery overvoltage and overcurrent are avoided, supporting a prolonged lifespan. Simulation results considering an autonomous microgrid operating under several scenarios are presented, to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed control scheme on steering the different topologies of converters.},

Each inverter supplies a current that is the result of the voltage difference between a reference ac voltage source and the grid voltage across a virtual complex impedance. The reference ac voltage source is synchronized with the grid, with a phase shift, depending on the difference between rated and actual grid frequency. A detailed analysis shows that this approach has a superior behavior compared to existing methods, regarding the mitigation of voltage harmonics, short-circuit behavior and the effectiveness of the frequency and voltage control, as it takes the R to X line impedance ratio into account. Experiments show the behavior of the method for an inverter feeding a highly nonlinear load and during the connection of two parallel inverters in operation.},

To improve the power quality in the grid, the distributed generation unit can be used as an active power filter (APF). When an active power filtering function is desired, the converter should have a neutral wire to allow neutral currents to flow. Therefore, two four-wire topologies, the four-leg and split-link converter, are compared in this paper. The comparison criteria are the ease of control, EMC performance, mid-point control, dc-bus voltage utilization and circuit complexity. It is concluded that a split-link topology is the best choice compared to a four-leg converter.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a unified control strategy that enables islanded and grid-connected operations of three-phase electronically interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs), with no need for knowing the prevailing mode of operation or switching between two corresponding control architectures. The proposed strategy benefits from both active feedback compensation and the droop method. It allows the employment of the same power circuit and control architecture for the islanded operation as those established and optimized for grid-connected power-electronic converter systems. The proposed strategy can be directly adopted for dispatchable systems (e.g., battery energy storage systems) or, alternatively, it can be embedded in a nested control loop for non-dispatchable systems. This paper presents the mathematical model on which the proposed strategy is based. Further, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through time-domain simulation of a two-unit test microgrid in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.},

Within this scenario, solar photovoltaics (PV) stand out as an essential source, supporting the transition to a cleaner and more efficient energy system. Despite notable advances in PV technology, their limitations substantially challenge solar energy harvesting efficiency. Owing to its negative consequences, partial shading has motivated the search for innovative and practical solutions to improve the performance of PV systems. This research explicitly addresses these limitations by proposing a reconfigurable system using a multi-port converter to independently extract the energy generated by shaded and unshaded panels by implementing a reconfiguration strategy using the Perturb and Observe (P \& O) technique. The reconfiguration strategy results are encouraging since 31\% of the energy extracted from the unshaded panels is recovered when the system is in partial shade presence. This breakthrough contributes to the efficiency of PV system optimization, thus highlighting the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy as a concrete solution to the current challenges in the solar energy field.},

This study proposes a coordinated power control strategy for the hybrid AC/DC microgrid with bidirectional interlinking converter (BIC) to achieve adaptive operation and performance enhancement, without switching control between normal and emergency conditions. Considering the limitation of the economic droop control under high load demand, a virtual output power control scheme is designed for distributed generations to operate adaptively among different power allocations, which can take into account the power supply reliability and economy. Based on introducing the resilience index to quantify the transferable resources between subgrids, the global power allocation and self-healing recovery are unified to improve the survivability of the interconnected system. Subsequently, a bidirectional virtual inertia mechanism is designed for the BIC to mitigate frequency and voltage variations by actively transmitting inertia power. Furthermore, an active disturbance rejection control is employed for the hybrid system to manage the power interaction, which observes and compensates for internal dynamics and external disturbances. The efficacy and superiority of the power control strategy is demonstrated in several case studies.},

The performance of design would be greatly reduced, when the system exists unknown disturbances or uncertainty. Therefore, some scholars pointed out that the dependency on the system models can be eliminated by data-driven design schemes. In this paper, the reinforcement learning-based methods are included, which appeal to attentions gradually. The disturbances rejection problem for motion control systems is studied based on reinforcement learning. Considering the continuity of state space and action space, a method based on deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to reject the periodic disturbances. Proposed deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) based algorithms are compared in simulation. The simulation results show that the periodic disturbances of the motion control systems can be rejected effectively with the proposed reinforcement learning controller.},

The first stage of control scheme is depended upon the P-V/Q-f droop control method, it is used when link-impedance is mainly resistive in nature. The second stage of control scheme is comprised to compensate for the deviation of voltage and current, which are depending upon load under grid connected mode and islanding mode. While changing the load on the AC side under grid connected mode, the operation is transferred to islanding mode. The two-stage control scheme is also utilized for bifurcation of active and reactive power. The proposed control scheme is verified in MATLAB/ Simulink environment.},

Complex droop control leverages the novel concept of "complex frequency", thereby establishing a coupled connection between active and reactive power inputs and frequency and rate-of-change-of voltage outputs. However, its reliance on static droop gains limits its ability to exhibit crucial dynamic response behaviors required in future power systems. To address this limitation, this paper introduces dynamic complex-frequency control, upgrading static droop gains with dynamic transfer functions to enhance the richness and flexibility in dynamic responses for frequency and voltage control. Unlike existing approaches, the complex-frequency control framework treats frequency and voltage dynamics collectively, ensuring small-signal stability for frequency synchronization and voltage stabilization simultaneously. The control framework is validated through detailed numerical case studies on the IEEE nine-bus system, also showcasing its applicability in multi-converter setups.},

We show how to transform this problem into a single-level, regularized, and direct data-driven control formulation, where the regularizer accounts for the least-square data fitting criterion. For this novel formulation, we carry out a robustness and performance analysis in presence of noisy data. In a numerical case study, we compare regularizers promoting either robustness or certainty-equivalence, and we demonstrate the remarkable performance when blending both of them.},

The coupling between oscillators is pulsatile: when a given oscillator fires, it pulls the others up by a fixed amount, or brings them to the firing threshold, whichever is less.The main result is that for almost all initial conditions, the population evolves to a state in which all the oscillators are firing synchronously. The relationship between the model and real communities of biological oscillators is discussed; examples include populations of synchronously flashing fireflies, crickets that chirp in unison, electrically synchronous pacemaker cells, and groups of women whose menstrual cycles become mutually synchronized.},

A coupled oscillator network is characterized by a population of heterogeneous oscillators and a graph describing the interaction among them. It is known that a strongly coupled and sufficiently homogeneous network synchronizes, but the exact threshold from incoherence to synchrony is unknown. Here we present a novel, concise, and closed-form condition for synchronization of the fully nonlinear, non-equilibrium, and dynamic network. Our synchronization condition can be stated elegantly in terms of the network topology and parameters, or equivalently in terms of an intuitive, linear, and static auxiliary system. Our results significantly improve upon the existing conditions advocated thus far, they are provably exact for various interesting network topologies and parameters, they are statistically correct for almost all networks, and they can be applied equally to synchronization phenomena arising in physics and biology as well as in engineered oscillator networks such as electric power networks. We illustrate the validity, the accuracy, and the practical applicability of our results in complex networks scenarios and in smart grid applications.},

  abstract = {This article presents a review of series-connected partial power converters (S-PPCs) for dc--dc applications, which allows carrying out the partial power processing (PPP), whose main goal is to achieve a reduction of the power processed by the converters. An analysis of the S-PPCs' characteristics, topologies, and applications concerning the active and nonactive power processing is presented. The power processing factor (PPF) is then defined, which refers to the active power and depends exclusively on the voltage regulation range. The so-called Fryze power factor (PF) is used to evaluate the nonactive power processed, which depends on the topology voltage and current waveforms. Due to the lack of research around step-up/-down S-PPCs, this article presents the restrictions and requirements for the design of this type of S-PPCs. Finally, it is demonstrated that the turns ratio of magnetic devices can be optimized to reduce the nonactive power and improve the converter Fryze PF, ensuring PPP. In order to validate the analyses, two 2200-W prototypes were built and evaluated for a photovoltaic (PV) application example. Experimental results show that the reduction of both the active and nonactive power processed by the S-PPCs results in lower component ratings and higher efficiencies.},

  abstract = {AC/DC hybrid microgrid is a promising architecture that allows for hosting energy resources and modern loads from AC and DC types; and in turn, it reduces the number of conversion stages among other technical and economical benefits. Consequently, power distribution planners started to investigate the possibility of hybridizing the existing AC grids and designing new AC/DC hybrid clusters referred to as microgrids as a step towards the envisioned smart grid with AC/DC technologies and ``plug-and-play'' feature. Nevertheless, while being islanded, AC/DC hybrid microgrids bring operational challenges to the system operation such as coordination among the distributed resources in both AC/DC subgrids, control and management of the power transfer through the interlinking converters, droop control of inverter-based distributed energy resources, and accurate power sharing. This paper looks closely at the problem of active and reactive power sharing in islanded droop-based AC/DC hybrid microgrids and proposes a unified power sharing scheme that is able to simultaneously ensure precise power sharing in both AC and DC subgrids. Test results demonstrate the capability of the proposed scheme in achieving exact power sharing not only among the energy resources in proportion to their ratings but also among the interlinking converters.},

An understanding of AC/DC HMGs and their operational premise during islanding will certainly pave the way toward the realization of a future smart grid that includes a plug-and-play feature. However, the planning and operation of such isolated and hybrid systems are reliant on a powerful and efficient power flow tool. To this end, this paper proposes a novel unified, generic, and flexible power flow algorithm for isolated AC/DC HMGs. The power flow subproblems related to AC and DC subgrids are described mathematically by a set of linear and nonlinear equations and are solved simultaneously using a Newton trust-region method. The proposed algorithm is generic in the sense that it includes consideration of the unique characteristics of islanded AC/DC HMGs: a variety of possible topologies, droop controllability of the distributed resources (DRs), and bidirectionality of the power flow in the interlinking converters (ICs). The new power flow formulation is flexible and permits the easy incorporation of any changes in DR operating modes and IC control strategies. The developed algorithm was tested and applied for analyzing selected operational and control aspects of isolated AC/DC HMGs, including inaccurate power sharing and interlinking converters characterized by differing control strategies. The proposed load flow program can form the basis of and provide direction for further studies of isolated AC/DC HMGs.},

  abstract = {AC/DC hybrid microgrids (HMGs) represent a promising architecture that allows the hosting of a mix of ac/dc energy resources and ac/dc loads. Despite their potential, when islanded, HMGs impose operational challenges among of which are precise and stable power sharing, frequency restoration, and voltage regulation. Imprecise power sharing can result in some distributed generators (DGs) being overloaded, while others being underloaded. This article proposes an optimal-power-flow-based optimal power sharing (OPS) scheme to optimize the droop characteristics of DGs and interlinking converters for global power sharing in a multi-DG HMG regardless of DG location and type. The optimized droop parameters might jeopardize the microgrid stability. Thus, the proposed OPS scheme preserves stable power sharing through stability-constrained optimization of the droop characteristics. In addition to DG overloading because of unequal power sharing, voltage-sensitive loads could possibly suffer from voltage deviations because of drooping the voltage with the load increase. The proposed OPS strategy enjoys the ability to regulate the ac/dc voltage within a desired range and restore the nominal frequency. Steady-state and time-domain simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed sharing scheme in achieving the underlying objectives. Test results also prove the capability of the OPS scheme in zonal power sharing in the case of a distribution grid with multizone ac/dc microgrids.},

This paper investigates the impact of the power flow direction on the small-signal stability of islanded droop-based HMGs. Firstly, a linearized state-space model of an HMG is developed. Secondly, eigenvalue analysis is carried out to realize the dominant modes, which are the rightmost eigenvalues. Thirdly, participation factor analysis is performed to identify the system and control parameters that effect stability the most. Lastly, sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the critical droop gains and stability margin. It is observed from the eigenvalue and sensitivity analysis that the dominant modes of HMGs become more stable as more power flows from dc to ac subgrid. On the contrary, an increase in the power flow from ac to dc subgrid degrades the HMG stability. Additionally, the sensitivity of the dominant modes to changes in ac and dc droop gains is studied under bidirectional power flow through the IC to ascertain their impact on the stability margins. Finally, time-domain simulations, in MATLAB/Simulink, suggest that more generation on the dc subgrid would enhance the overall HMG stability margin during islanding.},

  abstract = {Hybrid microgrids (HMGs) are impacted by a wide range of operational issues, which can lead to technical challenges for these systems. Power management and power sharing accuracy remain two major concerns due to lack of appropriate control strategies for bidirectional DC-DC converters (BDCs), which transfer power between distributed generations (DGs), such as electric vehicles (EVs), and HMGs. Similarly, interlinking converters (ICs), which are essential for power exchange between the AC and DC sides, can further intensify this challenge. Such deficiencies can pose threats to efficient operation of HMGs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 3-D droop-based control scheme for BDCs, designed to coordinate the performance of both EVs and BDCs on the DC side. This approach ensures accurate power sharing between BDCs despite unequal line resistances and enhances the overall power management of the HMG by involving EVs in meeting the load demand. Additionally, a novel approach for decoupling the charging and discharging modes of the EVs is introduced to eliminate circulating power among parallel BDCs. Consequently, BDC losses will be minimized, and their operational capacity remains unburdened, as unnecessary performance is avoided. Furthermore, a multi-purpose IC, formed by integrating a conventional single-stage IC with an adjustable distribution static synchronous compensator (DSTATCOM), equipped with a coordinated 3-D droop control is suggested. This not only facilitates the AC side voltage regulation (VR) through optimal reactive power compensation, but also ensures accurate reactive power sharing among parallel ICs. To accomplish this, the capacitance of the DC-link of the DSTATCOM is optimized by precisely tuning the proposed 3-D droop gains of the IC. The effectiveness of this control strategy is demonstrated and compared with other methods in the literature using an HMG testbed.},

The control of interlinking converters (ICs) that connect ac and dc MGs plays a vital role in the stability and efficiency of HMGs. However, conventional P-V droops for the dc side may not be effective due to line resistances and local nature of voltage. Also, conventional Q-V droops for the ac side may result in circulating power and current among parallel ICs diminishing their performance. In this paper, dc voltage harmonic frequencies are employed to create a global variable in the dc side of HMGs and to introduce an efficient droop control strategy for the dc MG without deteriorating power quality. Accordingly, accurate active power sharing is achieved and circulating power is eliminated. In addition, a threedimensional (3-D) droop is suggested for voltage control at the ac MG using virtual impedances. Thus, proper reactive power sharing is accomplished among parallel ICs, while circulating currents are suppressed as well. The optimal gains of the 3-D droop are determined via an optimization problem. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated by examining it on a typical HMG in different situations.},

Existing studies have often overlooked the compounded effects of bidirectional power flows and the dynamic nature of EV charging loads on system stability. The proposed strategy focuses on the interlinking converter (ILC) and employs an anti-windup (AW) mechanism combined with proportional-integral (PI) control to address stability issues caused by bidirectional power flows, variable load demands, and low DC-link voltage fluctuations. To fine-tune the AW and PI gains, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used, ensuring robust control performance that responds effectively to fluctuating power inputs from EV chargers. Compared to existing methods, this approach stabilizes power sharing between AC and DC sub-grids, reduces voltage fluctuations, enhances transient response, and minimizes grid current total harmonic distortion (THD). Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the control strategy, highlighting its capability to maintain microgrid (MG) stability under dynamic conditions and varied operating scenarios. The study affirms the feasibility of AW control for HMGs, offering a reliable solution for resilient energy distribution in modern electrical grids.},

All these, to name just a few, have made the establishment of a stable, flexible, controlled, well-designed, extensive, and clean power system a necessity. Consequently, distributed microgrid generation based on alternative/renewable energies and/or low-carbon technologies has emerged. In this paper, we study the modeling, the control, and the power management strategy of a grid-connected hybrid alternating/direct current (AC/DC) microgrid based on a wind turbine generation system using a doubly fed induction generator, a photovoltaic generation system, and storage elements including hydrogen storage system and batteries. Adequate modeling is described, and the overall system monitoring is presented and applied to manage appropriate power sharing and to control active and reactive powers, in order to match load and weather fluctuation behavior. Simulations are carried out using a MATLAB/Simulink simulation tool. Simulations reveal convenient results in terms of the bidirectional interlinking converter capabilities regarding power balance establishment between the two subgrids, reactive power compensation to ensure a unity power factor, and DC-bus voltage regulation at 1200 V. In addition, the primary and secondary controls are approved for each distributed generation of the studied system to attain the assigned power references, regardless of whether the subgrid is heavily or lightly loaded throughout the four considered case studies, showing satisfactory tracking and interacting performances, and thus stimulating a stable system implementation.},

  abstract = {Medium-voltage (MV) multilevel converters are considered a promising solution for large scale photovoltaic (PV) systems to meet the rapid energy demand. This article focuses on reviewing the different structures and the technical challenges of modular multilevel topologies and their submodule circuit design for PV applications. The unique structure of the converter's submodule provides modularity, independent control of maximum power point tracking (MPPT), galvanic isolation, etc. Different submodule circuits and MPPT methods to efficiently extract the PV power are reviewed. The integration of the multilevel converters to PV systems suffers unbalanced power generation during partial PV shading conditions. Several balancing strategies to solve this problem are presented and compared to give a better understanding of the balancing ranges and capabilities of each strategy. In addition, the paper discusses recent research advancements, and possible future directions of MV converters-based large-scale PV systems for grid integration.},

The consequence of replacing fossil-fuel synchronous generation with inverter-based renewables, such as wind and solar, leads to a paradigm shift from power systems dominated by synchronous machines to inverter-dominated power systems. When the share of inverter-based generation increases, the behavioral differences in terms of the grid services provided to the power network by generation become more salient. Services for grid stability that were historically inherently provided by synchronous generators now must be replaced by services from these inverter-based generation resources, other grid devices, or the combination of the two to ensure stable grid operation in the future as well.},

Traditionally, the intrinsic complexity of the design and development stages for implementing optimization algorithms in hardware has precluded the use of implicit formulations of MPC schemes for the control of DERs. In this work, we evaluate the possibilities provided by modern High-Level Synthesis tools to facilitate the fast-prototyping of implicit MPC schemes in reconfigurable logic devices that can overcome typical software limitations in terms of execution time and real-time requirements. In specific, we report a case-study that simulates a DER system controlled through an MPC scheme that uses the iterative Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the related optimization problem required for each control sampling interval. Experimental results using a Xilinx ZCU104 platform show that implementing the core of the ADMM algorithm in hardware reduces up to 10x the execution time of an MPC iteration in comparison to a software implementation executing in the same platform. The results provide experimental evidence about the potential of FPGAs for the implementation of advanced control schemes for DERs operating in microgrids.},

  abstract = {Secondary control strategies in hybrid ac/dc microgrids have been conventionally designed independently for each side of the microgrid, neglecting the interaction between the ac and dc sides due to the power transferred through the interlinking converter. This has a negative effect on the power sharing and dynamic response of the system. In this article, a novel distributed secondary control strategy for hybrid ac/dc-microgrids is presented which coordinates the control actions of the ac and dc sides. The proposed control scheme simultaneously regulates ac-voltage magnitude and frequency, as well as the dc-voltage magnitude, by including the interlinking converters in the control strategy via a distributed consensus approach. This improves the power-sharing accuracy and secondary control restoration of the variables in both ac and dc sides of the microgrid. Moreover, the proposed methodology avoids the circulating currents which are typically produced in systems with multiple interlinking converters. Several simulation and experimental tests, such as load impacts and plug-and-play capability, are presented to validate the performance of the proposed control strategy using a 24-kW hybrid ac/dc-microgrid laboratory prototype.},

The HVDC light system comprises of a rectifier station, a DC link, and an inverter station. Each converter station requires four PI controllers to be tuned in the decoupled d-q vector control scheme, and with the bidirectional HVDC system, the required PI controllers are doubled. Tuning these many controllers using conventional methods is a challenging task, especially if the parameters of the converter stations are different. A novel approach to tune the PI controllers for a bidirectional HVDC system using the time-domain performance indices is presented in this paper. The time-domain performance indices are optimized using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results of the proposed tuning method show that the proposed method not only gives superior results but also is less cumbersome to tune compared to conventional methods like modulus optimum (MO).},

The key link between AC subgrid and DC subgrid in a hybrid AC/DC microgrid, is the interlinking converter (IC), which should not only achieve power dispatch between AC subgrid and DC subgrid but also support AC or DC voltage. The unified control strategy of IC can cope with different operating conditions without operation mode detection and controller switch. It consists of several control loops, such as power dispatch control, droop control of IC and voltage control, where the same control parameters are used in three different operation modes (power control, AC voltage control and DC voltage control). As a result, the design of control parameters are vital for system stability. This paper presents parameters design method for unified controller. Moreover, a feedforward loop from the power dispatch loop to inner control loop is also proposed to improve the transient performance and stability. The analysis and proposed control strategy are verified by simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract = {The integration of dc microgrids (MGs) into distribution networks offers a promising solution to address the growing demand for electric energy by facilitating the incorporation of renewable energy sources and energy storage systems. To ensure sustained and reliable operation, dc MGs are commonly linked to utility grids through interlinking converters. However, with the increasing adoption of small-scale dc MGs for residential and commercial applications, the traditional approach of using a dedicated converter for each MG can significantly increase system size and cost. This paper proposes a single-stage non-isolated multiport converter (MPC) to interface the three-phase ac grid with 400 V dc MGs. The MPC enables direct power sharing between dc MGs, minimizes the dependence on the ac grid, and enhances the efficiency and power density of the power electronic interface compared to using multiple two-port converters. The motivations for the proposed converter include its single-stage power conversion among different ports, potentially leading to enhanced efficiency and power density. Furthermore, the absence of bulky intermediate dc-link capacitors and transformers in the proposed topology contributes to improved power density and reduced costs. Although designed for 400 V dc MGs in this study, the proposed MPC boasts buck-boost capability and bidirectional power flow at all ports, independent of the dc ports' voltage, providing the flexibility to directly interface with a wide range of dc systems. The performance of the converter is assessed through experimental tests under various operating conditions.},

  abstract = {Data-driven control approaches of permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) have gained significant attention due to their ability to eliminate reliance on analytical machine models and parameters. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a viable method for achieving a data-driven current control of the PMSM drive without the necessity of machine parameter information. In this approach, RL is trained offline to learn an optimal control policy, resulting in a computationally efficient controller compared to other data-driven control methods. However, standard RL methods struggle to adapt to new operating conditions and different parameter sets, reducing system performance and robustness. This research proposes a multiset robust RL (MSR-RL) based current control method for PMSM drives. MSR-RL leverages multitask RL to optimize a single policy that can generalize and provide robust performance across multiple parameter sets. The parameter sets, referred to as contexts, are represented as contextual Markov decision processes (CMDPs), capturing the dynamics associated with each parameter set. During the training phase, CMDPs with shared information are clustered into models. These models are then utilized to generate a unified policy that remains robust to all clustered and unseen models. The effectiveness of MSR-RL is validated through comparison with standard RL based on numerical simulations, experimental tests, and robustness evaluation. The findings highlight the advantages of MSR-RL in terms of adaptability, robustness, and performance of PMSM current control.},

The real-time certification of the algorithm is of paramount importance to move the technology toward industrial-scale applications. A relevant feature of the proposed solver is that the total number of operations can be computed in the worst-case scenario. Thus, the maximum computational time is known a priori. The solver is deeply illustrated, showing its feasibility for real-time applications in the microseconds range by means of experimental tests. The proposed method outperforms general-purpose algorithms in terms of computation time, while keeping the same accuracy.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) represents an affirmed optimal control strategy, able to handle multivariable systems and their input-output constraints. However, MPC does not provide an integral control action for reference tracking control problems. Several methods have been proposed to overcome this limitation. Standard MPC methods include a disturbance observer to handle unmodeled uncertainties, such as external unknown disturbances and parameter mismatches. Among these formulations, the authors focus on the velocity form MPC, which considers the incremental formulation of the motor state-space model. This formulation gets rid of the bias errors in reference tracking problems. In this article, the MPC paradigm is applied to the current control of synchronous motor drives. The intent is to compare the velocity form and the MPC with disturbance observer. A theoretical analysis of the MPC coupled with disturbance observers and the equivalence between these formulations and the velocity form is presented. Input constraints are included in the MPC optimization process, thus requiring an online quadratic programming solver. Experimental tests consider a 1 kW anisotropic synchronous motor. Numerical aspects regarding the optimization problem are investigated for both methods.},

The proposed method automatically and seamlessly rides through a fault on the grid side, and controls the microgrid's voltage and frequency during islanded operation. During an islanded operation, it utilizes the combination of distributed generation-energy storage similar to the prime mover of a synchronous generator to control the frequency. A comprehensive active and reactive power control is proposed that minimizes the usage of a local fossil-fuelled auxiliary generator. The method is based on expanding the so-called non-detection zone to all operational scenarios including islanded mode, hence having small ``undetectable'' voltage and frequency deviation. As soon as the grid is reconnected, the distributed generator is automatically and seamlessly synchronized with the grid. This is achieved through keeping phase-locked loop as a part of the operation in islanded mode without altering its phase angle. The proposed method is validated using PSCAD/ EMTDC simulation.},

A simplified model-free predictive current control (MFPCC) based on extended state observer (ESO) is proposed for open-winding permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (OW-PMLSM). The proposed method predicts currents based on the ultra-local model without using any motor parameters, and thus improving the system robustness. In addition, the computational burden of MPCC applied to an open-winding topology is considerable, as the number of the possible voltage vectors is increased to 64. Aiming to reduce the computational burden, a sequential structure evaluation function is designed, which can not only reduce the calculation burden, but also eliminate the weight factor. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified by experiments on a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

This paper proposes a control scheme based on the Lyapunov energy function (LEF) with output voltage feedback loops for the HDT series converter to overcome the limitations of the existing HDT control schemes, including steady-state error (SSE), and improve the transient response of the distribution network. Accordingly, an energy function is defined based on the energy of the series converter. The switching functions resulting from the control scheme based on the single-loop direct Lyapunov method (DLM) cause a significant SSE in the output voltage and distort the output voltage waveforms. The output voltage feedback loops of the LV network were added to the switching variables resulting from the LEF to fix the SSE, achieve fast-tracking of the reference voltage, and compensate for the sag or swell of the grid. Simulation and experimental results on an HDT experiment prototype confirmed the proposed control method's steady state and dynamic performance. As a result of combining the output voltage feedback loops in the control variables, the proposed method has stable and dynamic performance in fast-tracking the reference voltage and robustness to parametric uncertainty in the proposed HDT series converter. Simple implementation and understanding are other advantages of the proposed control scheme. As a result of combination the output voltage feedback loops in the control variables, the proposed method has stable performance, fast dynamics in tracking the reference voltage, and also robustness to parametric uncertainty.},

Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) based on batteries and supercapacitors (SC) have the potential to solve this issue.

It is proven that the application of this method leads to the definition of two quantities, the real and the imaginary power, that are measurable in a quite simpler way than those proposed by other theories. The two satisfy all properties typical of the electrical power and are directly related, under sinusoidal and balanced conditions, to the active and reactive powers.

This Systematic Review aims to summarize the existing evidence on the main problems and solutions for the development and operation of ILCs to serve HMGs, especially in relation to hardware, identify gaps in current research, and provide context for new research. Searches were carried out in the Scopus database, considering the period from January 2019 to August 2025, adopting the following inclusion criteria: articles published in journals, in English, and dealing with the development of the ILC, including the hardware and not only the control system. The total number of articles selected, adhering to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, was 36. The results showed that the most adopted converter topologies were the three-phase full bridge, the ten-switch converter, and the neutral point clamped. Among the most addressed research problems are low power quality, stability under different operating conditions, efficient power sharing management, and efficiency under different operating conditions. Despite the advances, there are still underexplored problems that can serve as topics for future research, such as converter optimization, reliability and cost analysis, topology selection, and definition of design methods.},

The configuration employs an isolated partial DC-DC power converters allowing to decouple the shaded parts from the unshaded at PV module level, maximizing the energy extracted.

  abstract = {PPP (Partial Power Processing) involves designing a converter that splits the processed power between two converters: one with a fixed conversion ratio and high efficiency, and the other with a variable conversion ratio and lower efficiency. Although the potential of this class of converter can be highly effective, it is not suitable for all applications. Literature lacks consistent terminology and clear definitions of which converter topologies perform true PPP. Some papers analyze the PPP as a general concept, others comparing specific conversion topologies. This paper aims to test a flyback converter prototype in the two layouts, explaining efficiency variations through advanced modeling and design methods. As expected, the partial power converter outperforms the full power converter. Performance is evaluated in terms of semiconductor component stress, snubber circuit impact, and overall efficiency.},

  abstract = {The Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm was inspired by the social and biological behaviour of bird flocks searching for food sources. In this nature-based algorithm, individuals are referred to as particles and fly through the search space seeking for the global best position that minimises (or maximises) a given problem. Today, PSO is one of the most well-known and widely used swarm intelligence algorithms and metaheuristic techniques, because of its simplicity and ability to be used in a wide range of applications. However, in-depth studies of the algorithm have led to the detection and identification of a number of problems with it, especially convergence problems and performance issues. Consequently, a myriad of variants, enhancements and extensions to the original version of the algorithm, developed and introduced in the mid-1990s, have been proposed, especially in the last two decades. In this article, a systematic literature review about those variants and improvements is made, which also covers the hybridisation and parallelisation of the algorithm and its extensions to other classes of optimisation problems, taking into consideration the most important ones. These approaches and improvements are appropriately summarised, organised and presented, in order to allow and facilitate the identification of the most appropriate PSO variant for a particular application.},

This developed theoretical analysis reveals that a conventional power feedback control scheme makes the UPFC induce power fluctuation in transient states. The conventional control scheme cannot attenuate the power fluctuation, and so the time constant of damping is independent of active and reactive power feedback gains integrated in its control circuit. This paper proposes an advanced control scheme which has the function of successfully damping out the power fluctuation. A UPFC rated at 10 kVA is designed and constructed, which is a combination of a series device consisting of three single-phase pulsewidth modulation (PWM) converters and a shunt device consisting of a three-phase diode rectifier. Although the dynamics of the shunt device are not included, it is possible to confirm and demonstrate the performance of the series device. Experimental results agree well with both analytical and simulated results and show viability and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

Among many others, Swarm Intelligence (SI), a substantial branch of Artificial Intelligence, is built on the intelligent collective behavior of social swarms in nature. One of the most popular SI paradigms, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO), is presented in this work. Many changes have been made to PSO since its inception in the mid 1990s. Since their learning about the technique, researchers and practitioners have developed new applications, derived new versions, and published theoretical studies on the potential influence of various parameters and aspects of the algorithm. Various perspectives are surveyed in this paper on existing and ongoing research, including algorithm methods, diverse application domains, open issues, and future perspectives, based on the Systematic Review~(SR) process. More specifically, this paper analyzes the existing research on methods and applications published between 2017 and 2019 in a technical taxonomy of the picked content, including hybridization, improvement, and variants of PSO, as well as real-world applications of the algorithm categorized into: health-care, environmental, industrial, commercial, smart city, and general aspects applications. Some technical characteristics, including accuracy, evaluation environments, and proposed case study are involved to investigate the effectiveness of different PSO methods and applications. Each addressed study has some valuable advantages and unavoidable drawbacks which are discussed and has accordingly yielded some hints presented for addressing the weaknesses of those studies and highlighting the open issues and future research perspectives on the algorithm.},

Some researchers have attempted to use a modulated approach to reduce the computational burden and improve the control performance. But these methods do not consider the actual physical limitations of the control system, and therefore the control performance degrades at high modulation indices or transients. To solve this problem, a modulated MPC with bound-constrained quadratic programming has been proposed. With this method, the optimal solution of the control problem can be obtained, ensuring a better control performance under high modulation index conditions or in transients. Finally, a comparative experiment with the conventional modulated MPC methods has been carried out. The experimental results validate that the proposed method can achieve superior performance when the MMC operates at high modulation index, transients, and low frequencies.},

  abstract = {Multilevel inverters (MLIs) have lately become important due to their extended application to electrical transmission and distribution systems. At the same time, the control and modulation of MLIs are especially challenging due to the high number of switching states, many of them redundant in terms of output voltage generation, and their nonlinear characteristics. In order to ease their implementation in real environment, model predictive control (MPC) is often considered, where the main control targets are: 1) to generate a the desired output current and 2) to keep the internal converter capacitor voltages at their reference value. However, a major issue with the implementation of MPC in MLIs is that the number of calculations to be done online increases dramatically with the number of levels, making it almost impossible to apply MPC in some practical cases. For these reasons, one of the main research trend in MPC for MLIs is to provide an algorithm which can reduce the computational burden necessary to operate the control. The article proposes a review of such control techniques. Starting from the basic MPC implementation and using a flying capacitor converter as an example the article review the basic strategies to avoid calculating the weighting factor in the cost function, simplifying the implementation. Also, methods to reduce the number of calculations necessary to implement MPC are shown and applied to cascaded H-bridge converters. These techniques allow to keep an high load current quality while reducing more than 95\% in the number of calculations necessary to implement the control. Finally, other operation improvements of MPC are also included, such as fixed switching frequency operation and multistep MPC, reaching an important performance improvement compared to the basic MPC strategy.},

The proposed design incorporates two switches, four diodes, one inductor, three capacitors, and a single coupled inductor. This configuration enables the converter to achieve a high voltage conversion ratio with a reduced number of components and low voltage stress on the MOSFETS. The low voltage stresses on the power components make the converter more cost-effective compared to other high step-up DC-DC converters. Additionally, some of the semiconductor devices in the proposed converter operate under zero-current switching (ZCS), notably less lessening switching losses and improving general efficiency. Since three out of the four diodes turn off under ZCS conditions, reverse recovery losses are minimized. Furthermore, the topology requires only one gate driver, further reducing costs. Theoretical analyses have been conducted and validated using simulation results obtained from MATLAB/Simulink software.},

A novel model predictive control scheme is proposed that keeps the motor torque, the stator flux, and (if present) the inverter's neutral point potential within given hysteresis bounds while minimizing the switching frequency of the inverter. Based on an internal model of the drive, the controller predicts several future switch transitions, extrapolates the output trajectories, and chooses the sequence of inverter switch positions (voltage vectors) that minimizes the switching frequency. The advantages of the proposed controller are twofold. First, as underlined by the experimental results in the second part of this paper, it yields a superior performance with respect to the industrial state of the art. Specifically, the switching frequency is reduced by up to 50\% while the torque and flux are kept more accurately within their bounds. Moreover, the fast dynamic torque response is inherited from standard DTC. Second, the scheme is applicable to a large class of (three-phase) AC electric machines driven by inverters.},

The inverter switch positions are directly set by the controller thus avoiding the use of a modulator. Admissible switching sequences are enumerated and a state-space model of the drive is used to predict the drive's response to each sequence. The predicted short-term switching losses are evaluated and minimized. The concept of extrapolation and the use of bounds achieve an effective prediction horizon of up to 100 time-steps despite the short switching horizon. When compared to classic modulation schemes such as pulse width modulation, for long prediction horizons, the switching losses and/or the harmonic distortion of the current are almost halved when operating at low pulse numbers, thus effectively resembling the steady-state performance of optimized pulse patterns. During transients the dynamic response time of the proposed controller is in the range of a few ms and thus very fast.},

The proposed controller does not require any complex transformation or input voltage sensing. A detailed analysis of the distortions in the line and the neutral currents is presented. It is shown that the single-carrier-based, conventional sine-triangle PWM (CSPWM) scheme results in a peak-to-peak neutral current ripple, which is greater than the peak-to-peak ripple of any of the line currents. Also, for the same operating condition, the distortions in the line and the neutral currents increase considerably, when a three-limb boost inductor is used instead of three single-phase inductors. A three-carrier-based SPWM scheme is proposed in this paper. Compared to CSPWM, the proposed scheme significantly reduces the neutral current ripple when three single-phase inductors are used, and reduces both line and neutral current ripples when a three-limb inductor is used. The control scheme is verified through Matlab simulation. It is implemented on an field-programmable gate-array (FPGA)-based digital controller and tested on a prototype.

The frequency domain techniques are based on the discrete Fourier transform and the fast Fourier transform. Examples of pitfalls in the common techniques are given.

  abstract = {To improve the performance of phase-locked loops (PLLs) under adverse grid conditions, incorporating different filtering techniques into their structures have been proposed in the literature. These filtering techniques can be broadly classified into in-loop and preloop filtering techniques depending on their position in the PLL structure. Inspired from the concept of delayed signal cancellation (DSC), the idea of cascaded DSC (CDSC) has recently been introduced as an effective solution to improve the performance of the PLL under adverse grid conditions. However, the focus has been on the application of CDSC operator as the prefiltering stage of PLL, and little work has been conducted on its application as the in-loop filtering stage of PLL. This paper provides a detailed analysis and design of dqCDSC-PLL (PLL with in-loop dq-frame CDSC operator). The study is started with an overview of this PLL. A systematic design method to fine tune its control parameters is then proposed. The performance of the dqCDSC-PLL under different grid scenarios is then evaluated in detail. It is then shown that how using the proportional-integral-derivative controller as the loop filter can improve the response time of dqCDSC-PLL. A detailed comparison between the dqCDSC-PLL and moving average filter (MAF) based PLL (MAF-PLL) is then carried out. Through a detailed mathematical analysis, it is also shown that these PLLs are equivalent under certain conditions. The suggested guidelines in this paper make designing the dqCDSC-PLL a simple and straightforward procedure. Besides, the analysis performed in this paper provides a useful insight for designers about the advantages/disadvantages of dqCDSC-PLL for their specific applications.},

  abstract = {This article presents a GPS-based decentralized control strategy for hybrid ac/dc microgrids. The proposed method uses V-I droop characteristics for the distributed energy resources (DERs) in each of ac and dc subgrids. In particular, the output voltage of each DER is adjusted as a piecewise linear function of the per-unit (pu) output current. In addition, a droop control method is proposed for the interlink converter (IC) to attain global power sharing among the dc and ac DERs. The IC controller changes the deviation of the ac bus voltage as a function of the deviation of the dc bus voltage. This way, the power flow between ac and dc subgrids is adjusted such that the ac and dc DERs experience the same pu voltage deviation and hence deliver the same pu current and active power. In contrast with the existing control approaches, the proposed method does not require frequency or power calculations but directly uses voltage and current measurements in the control loops. So the delay associated with the feedback signals is minimized, which avails accurate load sharing during transients. Experimental results show the proposed method eliminates the transient overshoots of DERs' output powers by offering a fast and overdamped dynamic response.},

  abstract = {Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) have achieved to enhance the flexibility of modern AC power systems, by providing fast, reliable and controllable solutions to steer the power flows and voltages in the network. The proliferation of High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission systems is leading to the opportunity of interconnecting several HVDC systems forming HVDC Supergrids. Such grids can eventually evolve to meshed systems which interconnect a number of different AC power systems and large scale offshore wind (or other renewable sources) power plants and clusters. While such heavily meshed systems can be considered futuristic and will not certainly happen in the near future, the sector is witnessing initial steps in this direction. In order to ensure the flexibility and controllability of meshed DC grids, the shunt connected AC-DC converters can be combined with additional simple and flexible DC-DC converters which can directly control current and power through the lines. The proposed DC-DC converters can provide a range of services to the HVDC grid, including power flow control capability, ancillary services for the HVDC grid or adjacent grids, stability improvement, oscillation damping, pole balancing and voltage control. The present paper presents relevant developments from industry and academia in the direction of the development of these converters, considering technical concepts, converter functionalities and possible integration with other existing systems. The paper explores a possible vision on the development of future meshed HVDC grids and discusses the role of the proposed converters in such grids.},

However, controlling multilevel converters is a complex task, which is typically implemented through single-input-single-output loops or via finite control set model predictive control (FCS-PC). Moreover, among the latest proposed multilevel converters, the five-level T-type nested neutral point clamped (5L-T-NNPC) stands out due to its reduced hardware requirements and wide voltage range applications. Although finite control set model predictive controller (FCS-MPC) has good performance with a fast dynamic response for operating this converter, this control strategy requires a detailed model of the converter, where parameter or model mismatch will degrade its performance. To improve the operation, this article proposes a novel model-free predictive control (MF-PC) that does not require a detailed model of the converter to operate, and it is robust under parameter mismatch. Indeed, it only requires the operation data of the converter to identify the parameters of a general autoregressive with exogenous (ARX) model via the least squares algorithm. Experimental and simulation results validate the better performance of the proposed MF-PC over the conventional FCS-MPC for a 5L-T-NNPC converter.},

This analysis considers the influence of the system's voltage gain, the auxiliary dc/dc converter's efficiency, and the possibility of bidirectional power flow. Herein, the key PPP architectures are, thus, modeled and benchmarked. The presented results attest to the series configuration as the most efficient PPP circuit solution, with no limits on the system voltage gain, contrary to the generalized results found in today's literature. To assess these results and the significance of the proposed analysis, a well-known, simple, and cost-effective flyback topology has been designed and tested for a series PPP circuit solution able to effectively interface a 5-kW battery energy storage system (BESS) to a 700-V dc grid. A relatively high power conversion efficiency and compact hardware are achieved due to the reduced size requirements on the input and output filtering stages. Above all, while explaining the PPP concept, this study shows that even converter circuits known for their low power efficiency can be used to derive highly efficient systems. A design approach is, thus, provided to facilitate the design of the presented PPP circuit, and measurements are, finally, carried out to compare the obtained results with the expected ones derived from the developed analytical models.},

The approximation space is spanned by stator voltages and currents preprocessed with different low-pass filters. The value of stator resistance does not occur openly in elaborated estimator, thus some level of robustness to its variations can be observed. The effectiveness of the novel approximation scheme has been confirmed in simulation as well as by experimental results. The results indicate its superiority to selected solutions based on back EMF integration (under assumption of no additional stator resistance identification algorithm). The performance of the DTC drive with ANN-based stator flux estimator has been compared to the analogous drives with PLPF (programmable low-pass filter)-based estimator and improved integration scheme with an amplitude limiter in polar coordinates. If the windings' temperature rises, there is observable speed dynamics deterioration during reversals of the latter ones, whereas there is no significant change in performance of the former one},

  abstract = {This paper is devoted to the field of artificial intelligence for drive control. In previous works, we presented possible advantages from using an artificial neural network (ANN) for speed control in a DTC-SVM (direct torque controlled-space vector modulated) drive. Learning of the neural controller was set on-line. Starting from a random configuration of the speed controller, the network adapts its weights according to an error criterion. Although the use of such specialized controller allows potential adaptive and robust control skills, tuning of an ANN for online learning control is a long iterative procedure. Indeed, optimization of the neural controller induces determination of ten parameters acting critically on the control dynamics. However, using optimization algorithms, one can reduce efforts to reveal this set of parameters. Several optimization algorithms are based on description of biological evolutions. We call such algorithms evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithm (GA) is a EA inspired by genetic processes leading human race toward optimal individuals capable of controlling their environment. This paper presents GA for optimization of ANN-based speed controller for induction motor drive.},

Partial Power Converter (PPC) systems represent one of the main streams of PPP, which, based on isolation requirements and converter connections, can further be divided into isolated converters, such as: Input-Parallel-Output-Series (IPOS), Input-Series-Output-Parallel (ISOP), and, Input-Series-Output-Series (ISOS), or non-isolated converters. This work intends to evaluate and differentiate the characteristics of each type of topology while developing analytically possible connections that may require further research and reviewing metrics that help in fair comparisons of different PPC arrangements, operating under different conditions.

To narrow the frequency range for high efficiency, a Switched-Capacitor LLC (SC-LLC) topology is proposed by regulating the input voltage of LLC converter via a reconfigurable SC converter. To further improve efficiency, a hybrid structure with partial power processing characteristic is proposed for the SC. The proposed hybrid structure has advantages in terms of frequency range and power distribution compared to the cascaded and sigma structure. Finally, a 120W prototype is built to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. The peak efficiency reaches up to 95.5\% at the input of 36V and the output of 12V/10A. Moreover, an overall efficiency ranging from 93.7\% to 95.4\% at full load is achieved across the entire voltage range. Besides, thanks to the high-power-density of the SC, the additional auxiliary circuit size is only increased by 9.4\%.},

The control loops are devised and analyzed taking into account the special nature of a low voltage microgrid, in which the line impedance is mainly resistive and the distance between the inverters makes the control intercommunication between them difficult. In contrast with the conventional droop control method, the proposed controller uses resistive output impedance, and as a result a different control law is obtained. The controller is implemented by using a DSP board, which only uses local measurements of the unit, thus increasing the modularity, reliability, and flexibility of the distributed system. Experimental results are provided from two 6 kVA inverters connected in parallel, showing the features of the proposed wireless control},

In this sense, a novel wireless controller is designed by using three nested loops: 1) the inner loop is performed by using feedback linearization control techniques, providing a good quality output voltage waveform; 2) the intermediate loop enforces the output impedance of the inverter, achieving good harmonic power sharing while maintaining low output voltage total harmonic distortion; and 3) the outer loop calculates the output active and reactive powers and adjusts the output impedance value and the output voltage frequency during the load transients, obtaining excellent power sharing without deviations in either the frequency or the amplitude of the output voltage.

  abstract = {Transformerless inverters, most of which are H-bridge inverters, have been widely used and studied in grid-connected power systems in the last decades. However, the H-bridge inverter is affected by the low- and high-frequency common-mode voltage between the input and output terminals, resulting in a large common-mode leakage current. An alternative solution is to connect the ground of the input terminal to the output load or grid, that is, the dual-grounded inverter. In this case, the low- and high-frequency common-mode voltages can be mitigated or eliminated. As a matter of fact, scholars have made several research results on dual-grounded inverters. However, as of now, there is still no literature that comprehensively and systematically summarizes these research results. To fill this gap, this article classifies different types of dual-grounded inverters from the perspective of topology for the first time, and compares and summarizes their advantages and disadvantages. More than 60 works of literature have been reviewed to identify the practical implementation challenges and research opportunities in the application of dual-grounded inverters.},

HDT can utilize the controllable capacity of the converter to achieve other functions while performing voltage conversion. One of the main functions of HDT is to solve the power quality problems of loads. The current power quality issues in the distribution system are reflected in the fact that the three phases are not completely identical. Therefore, the phase independent and controllable power quality management method is more suitable for the current distribution system. The phase separated independent controllable hybrid distribution transformer (SHDT) proposed in this article uses three single-phase converters to solve the power quality problems of each phase separately. Considering the different solutions to voltage and current issues, the mode switching switches are adopted to change the series parallel connection relationship of the converter, achieving two types of compensation functions while independently controlling the phase separation. Based on theoretical analysis, the function of phase independent compensation and the effect of mode switching were verified in the simulation platform.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the stability analysis and damping performance improvement of dc microgrids. The small-signal model of a dc microgrid has been derived. Eigenvalue analysis results reveal the relationship between the system stability and different factors of dc microgrids, including types of dc load, the droop coefficient, line parameters, etc. It shows that the poorly damped LC circuits in dc microgrids reduce the system damping and bring in high frequency oscillations. To improve the damping performance, a frequency-dependent virtual impedance approach is proposed, which can effectively shape the high frequency impedance of the dc bus voltage control units, improve the system stability, and mitigate the oscillations. Detailed design guidelines on virtual impedance to achieve good stability and transient performance are also provided. Simulation and experimental results are obtained to confirm the validity of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Multilevel inverters are increasingly being used in high-power medium voltage applications due to their superior performance compared to two-level inverters. Among various modulation techniques for a multilevel inverter, the space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) is widely used. However, the implementation of the SVPWM for a multilevel inverter is complicated. The complexity is due to the difficulty in determining the location of the reference vector, the calculation of on-times, and the determination and selection of switching states. This paper proposes a general SVPWM algorithm for multilevel inverters based on standard two-level SVPWM. Since the proposed multilevel SVPWM method uses two-level modulation to calculate the on-times, the computation of on-times for an n-level inverter becomes easier. The proposed method uses a simple mapping to achieve the SVPWM for a multilevel inverter. A general n-level implementation is explained, and experimental results are given for three-level and five-level inverters},

The conventional model-order reduction for a multiple-timescale system is based on discarding states with fast (short timescale) dynamics. It has been successfully applied to synchronous machines, but is inaccurate when applied to power converters because the timescales of fast and slow states are not sufficiently separated. In the method proposed here, several fast states are at first discarded but a representation of their interaction with the slow states is added back. Recognizing that the fast states of many converters are linear allows well-developed linear system theories to be used to implement this concept. All the information of the original system relevant to system-wide dynamics, including nonlinearity, is preserved, which facilitates judgments on system stability and insight into control design. The method is tested on a converter-supplied mini power system and the comparison of analytical and experiment results confirms high preciseness in a broad range of conditions.},

These converters offer the capability of both dc/ac and dc/dc power conversion, allowing for connection to either the ac bus or the dc bus through simple reconfiguration, thereby providing enhanced modularity and operational adaptability to various MG conditions.

This creates a challenge for designing the interlink converter between the ac and dc subgrids, since the different modes require different interlink controls. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the concept of a transfverter inspired by how transformers link ac grids. Like a transformer, a transfverter can react to the presence of stiff voltage sources on either the dc or ac side and reflect the ``stiffness'' and voltage stabilizing capability to the other side. A back-to-back converter with droop control is used as the underlying technology to implement this concept. A novel optimization method called model bank synthesis is proposed to find control parameters for the interlink converter that offer the best controller performance across the different microgrid modes without requiring mode changing of the controller. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is validated through both simulation and experiments.},

  abstract = {Inertia is a critical factor in maintaining the frequency stability of power systems. However, the growing integration of power electronics-based renewable energy sources (RESs) has significantly reduced system inertia. AC and dc microgrids have emerged as key solutions for integrating RESs. Unlike traditional synchronous generators, power electronic converters interfacing RESs lack inherent inertia and damping, posing challenges to the control and stability of these microgrids. To address these challenges, virtual inertia control strategies, which emulate the behavior of synchronous generators, have been widely adopted to enhance the stability of ac microgrids. Drawing on the analogies between ac and dc systems, similar virtual inertia concepts have been extended to dc microgrids, demonstrating their potential to improve system stability. This article provides a comprehensive review of inertia enhancement strategies for dc microgrids, examining their key features, benefits, and limitations. The analogy between synchronous generators/dc machines and energy storage systems is explored, with a particular focus on the implementation of virtual inertia and damping control in energy storage converters as a promising solution to mitigate power fluctuations. In addition, this article investigates the grid-forming and grid-following converter analogies in ac and dc microgrids. Various stability analysis methods applied to inertia enhancement strategies are also reviewed, offering readers a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research. By addressing the conceptual and technical analogies between ac and dc systems, this review aims to provide valuable insights for developing advanced control strategies for next-generation microgrids.},

It generally consists of multiple distributed generators that are usually interfaced to the grid through power inverters. For the islanding operation of ac microgrids, two important tasks are to share the load demand among multiple parallel connected inverters proportionately, and maintain the voltage and frequency stabilities. This paper reviews and categorizes various approaches of power sharing control principles. Simultaneously, the control schemes are graphically illustrated. Moreover, various control approaches are compared in terms of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, this paper presents the future trends.},

However, their complex operating modes and nonlinear dynamic characteristics lead to high switching losses and limited efficiency of the system under conventional control. In this paper, an optimization algorithm is combined with the multi-mode control of an FSBB converter for the first time, and a combined optimization and voltage closed-loop control strategy based on the Whale Migration Algorithm (WMA) is proposed. Under the four-mode operation conditions of the FSBB converter, the duty cycle and phase shift parameters of the switching devices are dynamically adjusted by optimizing the values to maximize the efficiency under different operation conditions, with the premise of achieving zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and the optimization objective of minimizing the inductor current as much as possible. Simulation results show that the proposed FSBB switching control strategy combined with the WMA algorithm improves the efficiency significantly over a wide voltage range (120--480 V) and under variable load conditions, and the transfer efficiency is improved by about 1.19\% compared with that of the traditional three-mode control, and the maximum transfer efficiency is 99.34\%, which verifies the validity and feasibility of the proposed strategy and provides a new approach to the high-efficiency control and application of FSBB converters.},

This article proposes a gain-free MPC method for a recently developed nine-level T-type converter (9L-T\textasciicircum\textbf{2}C), which offers advantages over traditional topologies, such as fewer components and improved efficiency. Drawing inspiration from Lyapunov's theory, this method avoids the use of weighting factors while effectively handling three targets, including current tracking, balancing of flying capacitors (FCs), and regulation of the neutral point (NP). Comparable with the traditional finite-control-set MPC (FCS-MPC), the proposed controller demonstrates high performance concerning all objectives. Additionally, it showcases superior resilience against model uncertainties when compared with the traditional approach. Experimental validation of the proposed MPC method is conducted in grid-connected operation under several conditions. The proposed method is subjected to a comparative analysis via the experimental implementation, where it is compared with a proportional-resonant (PR) controller and other state-of-the-art MPC methods. This analysis reveals the advantages of the proposed method, including eliminating the need for gains or weighting factors, improved robustness, and effective control of the FCs.},

While the reduced-order nonlinear dynamics of grid-forming, droop-controlled inverter-based microgrids have been rigorously shown to be stable for a wide range of operating parameters, the problem of analyzing the transient stability characteristics of droop-controlled hybrid ac/dc architectures has not been adequately addressed. This work reviews the link between the Virtual Synchronous Machine control concept and grid-forming droop control, and introduces a new droop control strategy for ac/dc hybrid microgrids, termed `symmetric droop control' (SDC). SDC better addresses the dynamic interactions between the ac and dc sub-grids of the hybrid microgrid, by ensuring that the interfacing inverter appropriately represents the dc sub-grid dynamics when interacting with other inverters. SDC can help to ensure that the reduced-order, nonlinear dynamics in both the ac and dc networks remain predictable and well-behaved during large disturbances in the ac network.},

Optimal design of LC filter, controller parameters, and damping resistance is carried out in case of grid-connected mode. On the other hand, controller parameters and power sharing coefficients are optimized in case of autonomous mode. The control problem has been formulated as an optimization problem where particle swarm optimization is employed to search for optimal settings of the optimized parameters in each mode. In addition, nonlinear time-domain-based as well as eigenvalue-based objective functions are proposed to minimize the error in the measured power and to enhance the damping characteristics, respectively. Finally, the nonlinear time-domain simulation has been carried out to assess the effectiveness of the proposed controllers under different disturbances and loading conditions. The results show satisfactory performance with efficient damping characteristics of the microgrid considered in this study.

First, according to the topology of multiport hybrid microgrid, the conventional ac--dc coupling characteristics are analyzed, and a different coupling analysis method considering energy conservation and capacity difference is introduced. Then, the regulation demands when multi sub-grids encounter net power changes are analyzed in detail, based on which the designing principles of the proposed strategy are elaborated. Further, the state space models of ac and dc sub-grids are built separately based on their respective physical characteristics, derived from which the hybrid microgrid model is obtained and serves for the control scheme design. Subsequently, a novel mutual support power control strategy based on MPC is proposed, of which the implementation procedure is elaborated, the key parameters are discussed, and the stability is theoretically analyzed. The proposed strategy can achieve good performance of frequency and voltage regulations with less cross-grid power transmission. The performance of the proposed control strategy is validated by the hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments based on RT-LAB platform.},

Specifically, the voltage regulation term is integrated together with the power regulation term into a newly constructed cost function so that the control of dc-link voltage as well as power can be realized by a single cost function. To predict accurately and to reduce the sensitivity to variable parameters, the expressions of dc-link voltage and power are dynamically corrected, thus enhancing the robustness. In addition to presenting no tracking deviation in steady state, the dc-link voltage also presents smaller deviation from reference and faster recovery time in dynamics. It is beneficial to enhancing the reliability of system since the voltage surge on power switches and diodes has been reduced. Besides, controllable power flow, sinusoidal phase current, and well-regulated electromagnetic torque can be achieved in the system as well. A series of experiments are carried out to test the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Performance comparisons with the classical proportional integration controller-based MPC and the modified cascade-free quasi-centralized MPC validate the improvements of the proposed control scheme.},

This emerging notion is of significance as it accommodates the multivariable characteristics of power networks, where active power and reactive power are inherently coupled with both voltage amplitude and phase. We propose the notion of complex-frequency synchronization to study the phase--amplitude multivariable stability issue in a power system with dispatchable virtual oscillator-controlled converters. To achieve this, we separate the system into linear fast dynamics and approximately linear slow dynamics. The linearity property makes it tractable to analyze fast complex-frequency synchronization and slower voltage stabilization. From the perspective of complex frequency and complex-frequency synchronization, we provide novel insights into the equivalence of dispatchable virtual oscillator control and complex-power--frequency droop control, stability analysis methods, and stability criteria. Our study offers a practical solution to address challenging stability issues in converter-based power systems.},

Cross-forming refers to voltage angle forming and current magnitude forming. It differs from classical grid-forming and grid-following paradigms that feature voltage magnitude-and-angle forming and voltage magnitude-and-angle following (or current magnitude-and-angle forming), respectively. The cross-forming concept addresses the need for inverters to remain grid-forming (particularly voltage angle forming, as required by grid codes) while managing fault current limitation. Simple and feasible cross-forming control implementations are proposed, enabling inverters to quickly limit fault currents to a prescribed level while preserving voltage angle forming for grid-forming synchronization and providing dynamic ancillary services, during symmetrical or asymmetrical fault ride-through. Moreover, the cross-forming control yields an equivalent system featuring a constant virtual impedance and a ``normal form'' representation, allowing for the extension of previously established transient stability results to include scenarios involving current saturation. Simulations and experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed cross-forming control implementations.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the resonance problem in a parallel-inverter-based grid-interactive microgrid. Unlike the single grid-connected inverter system where the resonance frequency is mainly fixed by the inverter output LCL filter parameters, the parallel-inverter-based grid-interactive microgrid system presents a more challenging picture where inverter interactions will excite complex resonances at various frequencies. As a result, line currents of inverters can be severely distorted even when the control schemes and filter circuits are properly designed based on the single-inverter model. This paper first develops a microgrid model using discrete time-domain closed-loop Norton's equivalent circuit. Multiple resonances can then be evaluated with the developed model. To improve the microgrid power quality, this paper also designs a virtual-harmonic-resistance-based active damping method. The proposed damping method can be seamlessly incorporated into the conventional deadbeat control scheme through the direct control reference modification. Therefore, the active damping method is able to address both the transient and steady-state resonances within the deadbeat current control bandwidth. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the correctness of the developed resonance modeling and active damping methods.},

The dynamic analysis based on the complex notation exhibits a formal correspondence to the description using matrices of axes-oriented components; yet differences exist. The complex notation appears superior in that it allows the distinguishing between the system eigenfrequencies and the angular velocity of a reference frame which serves as the observation platform. The approach leads to the definition of single complex eigenvalues that do not have conjugate values associated with them. The use of complex state variables further permits the visualization of AC machine dynamics by complex signal flow graphs. These simple structures assist to form an understanding of the internal dynamic processes of a machine and their interactions with external controls.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {The proliferation of distributed energy resources is setting the stage for modern distribution systems to operate as microgrids, which can avoid power disruptions and serve as resources for fast recovery during macrogrid disturbances. Microgrids are, therefore, major assets to improve the grid resilience. However, the offered resilience is seriously undermined if microgrids are not properly protected in the event of faults within their own boundaries. Distribution protective devices cannot reliably protect microgrids due to the variable and often limited short-circuit capacities of microgrids. Moreover, the research on microgrid protection has not led to a commercially available microgrid relay to date and has little prospect of reaching that level in the near future. As a result, the existing options for reliable microgrid protection remain effectively the subtransmission and transmission system protective devices, e.g., directional overcurrent, distance, and differential relays. Although years of operation in macrogrids support these relays, their performance for microgrids is yet to be analyzed. This paper presents such analysis for different relay types by considering various fault and generation conditions in a microgrid. Time-domain simulations are used to identify the scenarios where the relays function correctly as well as the problematic conditions, on which future research should focus. This paper also presents a short review on direct current (dc) microgrids and their protection requirements.},

  abstract = {Over the ages, nature has constantly been a rich source of inspiration for science, with much still to discover about and learn from. Swarm Intelligence (SI), a major branch of artificial intelligence, was rendered to model the collective behavior of social swarms in nature. Ultimately, Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is arguably one of the most popular SI paradigms. Over the past two decades, PSO has been applied successfully, with good return as well, in a wide variety of fields of science and technology with a wider range of complex optimization problems, thereby occupying a prominent position in the optimization field. However, through indepth studies, a number of problems with the algorithm have been detected and identified; e.g., issues regarding convergence, diversity, and stability. Consequently, since its birth in the mid-1990s, PSO has witnessed a myriad of enhancements, extensions, and variants in various aspects of the algorithm, specifically after the twentieth century, and the related research has therefore now reached an impressive state. In this paper, a rigorous yet systematic review is presented to organize and summarize the information on the PSO algorithm and the developments and trends of its most basic as well as of some of the very notable implementations that have been introduced recently, bearing in mind the coverage of paradigm, theory, hybridization, parallelization, complex optimization, and the diverse applications of the algorithm, making it more accessible. Ease for researchers to determine which PSO variant is currently best suited or to be invented for a given optimization problem or application. This up-to-date review also highlights the current pressing issues and intriguing open challenges haunting PSO, prompting scholars and researchers to conduct further research both on the theory and application of the algorithm in the forthcoming years.},

Residential distributed energy resources (DERs) and single-phase loads typically connect to the medium-voltage grid directly via separate single-phase transformers and converters. These separate connections result in power imbalances, equipment redundancy, increased costs, and issues with power quality and converter coordination for both low-voltage users and the medium-voltage grid. This paper proposes a novel V/V-connected hybrid distribution transformer (VV-HDT) designed to integrate loads and DERs efficiently, while actively controlling voltage and current to enhance power quality and isolate faults. It utilizes a modified V/V transformer for voltage conversion and primary power transmission, with partial power managed by smaller capacity converters. The V/V transformers offer mutual power circuits, providing hardware basis for resolving power imbalances and facilitating the expansion of needed transformer capacity. The paper elucidates the VV-HDT's voltage and current control mechanism, the equivalent model of the modified V/V transformer, port power flow analyses, and the coordination control strategy under normal and grid fault conditions. Simulations and prototype experiments confirm the VV-HDT's effectiveness and control strategy.},

In order to simplify systematic coordination with BIC and central controller, BRDT is designed as an ideal transformer with simple openloop scheme. 50\% duty ratio scheme is implemented as it has been proven to be better than the phase-shift scheme in order to ensure BRDT conversion efficiency. A generalized model for various BRDT topologies, including CLLC, CLL, and LLC high frequency transformer (HFT), is established for analysis. The impacts induced by the transformer leakage, magnetizing inductances, and extra resonant capacitors are considered when designing the HFT. The conversion gain of the designed BRDT has also been analyzed in the full power range. Lab-scale prototypes for BRDT and hybrid ac/dc microgrid have been developed for experimental verifications. The performances of BRDT and system in both steady and transient states have been confirmed.},

  abstract = {CLLC-type dc transformer (CLLC-DCT) is very popular in the hybrid ac--dc microgrid thanks to its highpower density advantage and good bidirectional power transfer capacity. In the hybrid ac/dc microgrid, the openloop control is always utilized by the CLLC-DCT to cooperate with the bidirectional interlinking converter to realize the power and voltage conversion between the ac and dc bus. This paper first studies the circuit parameters design of the open-loop controlled CLLC-DCT with consideration of such a realistic problem: The real inductors/capacitors values are actually different with their theoretically designed values due to the operation power and temperature variation. To solve this problem, a robust circuit parameters design scheme is proposed for the CLLC-DCT in this paper. With the proposed scheme, the designed CLLC-DCT exhibits good power transmission and voltage regulation ability in the hybrid ac/dc microgrid even when its actual inductors/capacitors values vary with the practical power and temperature. The robust design method is experimentally verified in a hybrid ac/dc microgrid prototype.},

  abstract = {Solid-state transformers (SSTs) are power electronic converters that provide isolation between a medium-voltage and a low-voltage (LV) system using medium-frequency transformers. The power electronic stages enable full-range control of the terminal voltages and currents and hence of the active and reactive power flows. Thus, SSTs are envisioned as key components of a smart grid. Various SST concepts have been proposed and analyzed in literature concerning technical aspects. However, several issues could potentially limit the applicability of SSTs in distribution grids. Therefore, this paper discusses four essential challenges in detail. It is found that SSTs are less efficient than low-frequency transformers (LFTs), yet their prospective prices are significantly higher. Furthermore, SSTs are not compatible with the protection schemes employed in today's LV grids, i.e., they are not drop-in replacements for LFTs. The limited voltage control range typically required in distribution grids can be provided by competing solutions, which do not involve power electronics (e.g., LFTs with tap changers), or by hybrid transformers, where the comparably inefficient power electronic stage processes only a fraction of the total power. Finally, potential application scenarios of SSTs (ac-dc, dc-dc, weight/space limited applications) are discussed. All considerations are distilled into an applicability flowchart for SST technology.},

Traditional transformers have problems such as poor voltage regulation performance and easy voltage overrun, which seriously affect the stability and quality of power supply, which brings challenges to the safe and reliable operation of the power grid. This paper proposes an electromagnetic-electronic hybrid distribution transformer, which combines a traditional transformer and a partial power electronic converter to solve the problems of poor voltage regulation performance and voltage overrun of the traditional transformer. Meanwhile, this paper introduces its system theory, including the design method of multi-winding electromagnetic transformers and the topology and control structure of power electronic converters. This paper also constructs an AC-DC-AC converter voltage regulation system based on fully controlled power semiconductor devices, which regulates the voltage by PWM pulse width modulation of the rectifier-inverter circuit. Simulation results confirm the feasibility of the designed electromagnetic-electronic hybrid distribution transformer.},

The input current ripple is decreased due to the interleaved operation and the voltage stress of the switches is only 1/6 of the output voltage when the turn ratio is 1. So the high-performance MOSFETs with low ON-state resistance can be used to reduce the conduction losses. The reverse-recovery problem of the output diode can be suppressed by the leakage inductance of the coupled inductors. The leakage inductance energy of the coupled inductors is absorbed and recycled to the output, which can largely improve the efficiency of the proposed converter. The working principle and steady-state characteristics of the converter are analyzed in detail. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified through experimental results of a 400-W laboratory prototype.},

It combines the LFT's efficiency and reliability with the added advantage of partial power controllability via an integrated converter. However, the existing research on the HDT fault ride-through does not consider the coordination relationship with its own safe operation constraints, while few studies have considered capacity coordination between multiple converters. Therefore, this article proposes an improved hierarchical coordination control of integrated HDT (IHDT), considering grid fault and normal conditions. First, the IHDT topology is proposed, and the operation mechanism of IHDT to realize the voltage support and current compensation is clarified by analyzing the coupling mechanism between the converter and LFT. Furthermore, under complex conditions, the unified expressions of the IHDT winding voltage, current, and power are derived, the safe operation constraints of IHDT are analyzed, and a hierarchical coordination control strategy is proposed. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the IHDT topology and control strategy are demonstrated by simulation analysis and experimental verification.},

  abstract = {This article highlights a voltage instability when the bidirectional interlinking converter (BIC) of a hybrid ac-dc microgrid operates as a constant power load (CPL). The instability is attributed to the impedance interactions seen at the dc port of the BIC. The BIC is operated with two different controllers, viz., a PI controller and a model predictive controller (MPC). In order to avert the instability, prohibiting impedance interactions is proposed as a design objective while determining the bandwidth of the PI controller. However, since a flexible control over bandwidth is not available with MPC, an active damping technique is proposed to address the instability. The proposed technique works equally well for the PI controllers with fixed or predetermined bandwidths. An important feature of the proposed technique is that it does not interfere with the original objectives of the controllers, once the instability is addressed. The technique comprises only one tuning factor, which does not depend on the BIC's internal parameters. As a result, it can easily be implemented as a general stabilizing scheme in any BIC. The efficacy of the proposed technique is verified through simulations, frequency-domain impedance analyses as well as experiments on a laboratory prototype of the BIC.},

  abstract = {The development of AC distribution systems provides for the seamless integration of low-voltage microgrids with distributed energy resources (DERs). This poses new challenges for the control of normal, emergency, and post-emergency states of microgrids, calling for the creation and development of information and communications technology infrastructure. Power converters/inverters that are used to integrate renewable DERs lack inertia. Along with them, fossil fuel-fired generation units are also being integrated into microgrids. These include gas generator sets, diesel generator sets, and microturbines, having small (up to 1--2 s) values of mechanical inertia constants---Tj. This leads to an increase in the rate of transients by a factor of 5--10. Under these conditions, the technical requirements for the speed of automatic power flow control systems, as well as the methods they rely on, have to be reconsidered. Microgrids include DC microgrids, AC microgrids, and hybrid (AC-DC) microgrids. In the case of hybrid microgrids, DERs are connected to the DC grid and are integrated into the AC grid through a common inverter. The complexity of the task of microgrid control is due to the need to choose properly the type and extent of control actions so as to prevent the emergence and development of accidents. The employed control methods must ensure the reliable power supply to consumers and the quality of power in microgrids, as well as the reliable operation of the external distribution systems into which they are integrated. The article gives an overview of control methods for low-voltage AC and AC-DC microgrids, which allow one to tackle effectively solve the tasks.},

  abstract = {Modern utility grid is experiencing a transition from conservative centralized generation structure to a more distributed and decentralized structure. To achieve this transition, decentralized energy sources and loads must be seamlessly integrated and isolated from main grid structure. Realization of one such approach is termed as ``Microgrid''. Microgrids (MGs) are a source of clean, efficient, and an economical way to integrating renewable energy sources and loads to the main grid. Higher penetration levels of MG would lead to significant perturbations with time periods being lower than conventional dynamic responses. This may pose problems of stable operation for the entire utility grid. For addressing this problem, this paper gives an in-depth literature review on the different control structure of MGs. As control dynamics required vary significantly, depending upon the integrated source, connected loads and ratings of the MG, it is important to understand the different structures of MG. Thus, categorization of MG based on different criteria such as distributed energy resources (DERs), type of distribution systems, modes of operation, and types of communication links used are first studied. As modern control structures are layered to achieve dynamic responses at different time constants, hierarchical controls are implemented. To address this concern, different levels of hierarchical controls are also discussed along with the control strategies of integrating various renewable energy resources in MGs. Different methods of controls are analyzed and assessed in each category and the major issues faced in the current infrastructure are noted. As the grid is moving towards optimal design of microgrid structures this manuscript reviews a number of optimization techniques along with their benefits and drawbacks.},

Unfortunately, the corresponding training phase is a time-consuming and possibly money-consuming process, which needs to be repeated whenever application to a new plant system is requested. To reduce the total training time for a large set of heterogeneous plant systems, this article proposes a meta-reinforcement-learning-based approach that is to be utilized for the control of hundreds of different permanent magnet synchronous motor drives ranging from a few watts to hundreds of kilowatts. The so-called context variables carry the meta-information about the set of considered drive systems. Their estimation using a corresponding artificial neural network as context approximator is a core aspect of this article. The context information allows the reinforcement-learning-based control algorithm to automatically adapt itself to individual motor drives without requiring individual plant training. Since the found context variables can also be interpreted as an implicit system identification result, they allow us to determine irregular plant behavior (e.g., faulty drives) as an added bonus of the proposed meta-reinforcement learning scheme. Empirical results during this proof of concept successfully validate the potential of the proposed approach to drastically reduce the total training time and encourage further research.},

  abstract = {The Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) Multi-Level Inverters (MLI) have been ruling the power electronics industries for the past two decades. The Multi-Carrier Pulse Width Modulation (MCPWM) is common PWM techniques which are widely used in NPC-MLI applications. However, MCPWM is not having a good impact on the balancing of DC-link voltages, Common Mode Voltage (CMV) and limiting the Total Harmonics Distortion (THD). The Selective Harmonic Elimination (SHE) technique is introduced for reducing the THD, however all the switching angles should be maintained less than {$\pi$}/2 to keep the eliminated harmonics at constant level which narrows down the modulation index range. Hence, in recent days Space Vector Modulation (SVM) technique is widely used in NPC-MLI, which gives better DC-link voltage balancing, self-neutral point balancing, near-zero CMV reduction, better-quality harmonics profile and switching loss minimization. Hence, it is a preferred solution for the majority of electrical conversion applications such as electric traction, high power industrial drives, renewable power generation, and grid-connected inverters, etc. The paper gives a comprehensive review of the SVM for NPC-MLI. First, this paper deliberates the state of art for two-level SVM and extends it to three-level (3L) SVM. Also compares the 3L SVM performance with other MCPWM techniques. Followed by the various modified MLI SVM techniques in terms of their implementations, DC-link capacitor balancing, and reduction of CMV. Further, the review of MLI SVM is widened to open-end winding Inverters and multiphase MLIs. The final part of this paper discussed the future trends and research directions on MLI SVM techniques and its applications.},

In this case the problem can be solved with an interior-point method in time linear in the horizon length.

The prime focus of the power management algorithm is to feed the ac loads, and dc loads from ac source, and photovoltaic battery energy storage (BES), respectively. The second objective is to utilize the solar power to maximum capacity, by feeding it to dc load, BES, and ac load, in the given order of priority. The ac and dc subgrids operate independently, while supporting each other in case of overloading/underloading, thus reducing the amount of power reserve required in each, and eliminating the need of dump loads. The ANFIS-MN-based power quality control is integrated in order to ensure the total harmonics distortion of ac source current remains below 5\% as per IEEE 519 standard, irrespective of the nature of load connected. In addition, the ILC control prevents any negative sequence currents from entering the ac source, even if there is any open circuit fault leading to unbalanced loading on the three phases. The performance of ANFIS-MN-based ILC control is demonstrated to be superior when compared with the conventional and contemporary techniques under different scenarios.},

The HESS is made up of a supercapacitor (SC), a battery, and a fuel cell (FC) with complementary characteristics. The modeling of the test system, which consists of an IC control structure with virtual synchronous machine-transient (VSM-T) droop and HESS control, is outlined in this article. The modified IC topology improves the power-sharing between sub-grids and enhances the steady-state and transient responses. The novelty of the proposed strategy is that the power ratio index-based power management approach is executed through a single controller using local measurements. Furthermore, the adaptive nature of the reference generation improves the active and reactive power-sharing of the IC and the simultaneous voltage regulation at AC and DC sub-grids. The performance of a HMG under varying loading and irradiation, distributed generation (DG) outage, and electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) charging are analyzed on a modified IEEE 13-bus HMG test system and validated using OPAL-RT real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments. Furthermore, the adaptive nature of reference generation in the proposed approach improves power-sharing during both volatile and normal loading. The proposed PMS provides a voltage improvement of 7.92\% at the AC sub-grid, and 0.42\% at the DC sub-grid of the HMG.},

The microgrid needs a high-performance controller to reduce the overshoot value that affects the efficiency of the network. However, the high voltage value causes the inverter to stop. Thus, an improved power-sharing response to the transfer between these two modes must be insured. More important points to study in a microgrid are the current sharing and power (active or reactive) sharing, besides the match percentage of power sharing among parallel inverters and the overshoot of both active and reactive power. This article aims to optimize the power response in addition to voltage and frequency stability, in order to make this network's performance more robust against external disturbance. This can be achieved through a self-tuning control method using an optimization algorithm. Here, the optimized droop control is provided by the H-infinity (H{$\infty$}) method improved with the artificial bee colony algorithm. To verify the results, it was compared with different algorithms such as conventional droop control, conventional particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony algorithms.

In this article, the CM voltage of the three-phase converter with the proposed APF is analyzed to explain the CM voltage reduction using the proposed APF. Based on this analysis, the application of a specific PWM method to the three-phase converter for an optimal reduction of the CM voltage is described. Besides, the APF circuit design and its switching method are proposed considering practical problems such as the self-resonance of inductors and the effect of the dead-time on the CM voltage. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed APF on the CM voltage reduction, experimental results for the CM voltage and current are presented in this article. Furthermore, EMI noise measurement results are shown to verify the performance of the noise reduction capability of the proposed APF.},

  abstract = {For gas insulated switchgear (GIS), the loop resistance is a good indicator of the health status, which can be measured with dc voltage drop method. Usually, large dc current is demanded for the measurement due to the small loop resistance, and hence a bulky power electronics converter is needed. Aiming to obtain high power density and low cost, this paper proposes a partial power processing dc current source as a substitution for the conventional one. Because only part of the power is transferred through the converter and the rest is directly delivered from the input to the output, the power ratings of active/passive components are much decreased in the proposed scheme. Therefore, it is very attractive for the condition monitoring of GIS. In the paper, a practical partial power processing dc current source based on the current-fed full-bridge converter is firstly proposed. Afterwards, its operational principle, performance characteristics and design considerations are analyzed in detail to achieve a comprehensive understanding.

  abstract = {The microgrid concept is gaining widespread acceptance in near-term future power networks. Medium-voltage (MV) microgrids can be subjected to a high penetration level of dynamic loads [e.g., induction motor (IM) loads]. The highly nonlinear IM dynamics that couple active power, reactive power, voltage, and supply frequency dynamics challenge the stability of MV droop-controlled microgrids. However, detailed analysis and, more importantly, stabilization of MV microgrids with IM loads, are not reported in current literature. To fill in this gap, this paper presents integrated modeling, analysis, and stabilization of MV droop-controlled microgrids with IM load. A detailed small-signal model of a typical MV droop-controlled microgrid system, which is based on the IEEE Standard 399, with both dynamic and static loads is developed. The proposed model accounts for the impact of supply frequency dynamics associated with the droop-control scheme to accurately link the microgrid frequency dynamics to the motor dynamics. To stabilize the microgrid system in the presence of IM loads, a 2-degree-of-freedom active damping controller is proposed to stabilize the newly introduced oscillatory dynamics. The proposed supplementary active damping controller does not interfere with the steady-state performance, and yields robust control performance under a wide range of droop parameters and robust damping performance at small- and large-signal disturbances. A theoretical analysis, simulation, and experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

One of the main objectives of this article is to reduce the cost of inverter-based DVR by reducing both the size of the dc-link capacitor and rating of switching elements. The voltage of the dc-link capacitor is regulated to low voltage level using a transformer and a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) rectifier to achieve both effective voltage regulation and drawing a sinusoidal line current from the grid and thus not to contribute to the increase of the THD of the utility current. Furthermore, the voltage across the switches can be limited to low value by an adequate design of dc-link capacitor size, capacitor voltage, and sag level to be compensated. Finally, the effectiveness and fast response of the proposed DVR for the compensation of voltage disturbances and current harmonics is confirmed by simulation using MATLAB/Simulink during the steady-state and transient operations to analyze the performance of the scheme under different operating conditions.},

Increasing switching frequencies, linked in part to wide bandgap devices, provide the opportunity to increase operating bandwidth and enhance performance. Fast processors and digital signal processing offer new computational techniques for power converter control. Conventional control techniques rarely make full use of operating capability. The objectives of this paper are to present an overview and link to literature on conventional modulation and control techniques for hard-switched dc-dc converters, identify performance limits associated with conventional small-signal-based design, discuss geometric control approaches, and compare strategies for control tuning. The discussion shows how current mode controls have alternative state feedback implementations, and describes unusual opportunities for large-signal control tuning. Considerations for minimum response time are described. Comparisons among tuning methods illustrate how geometric controls can achieve order of magnitude dynamic performance increases.

Although both approaches are implemented as direct control methods, i.e., they combine control and modulation in one computational stage, they operate the converter at a constant switching frequency and generate a discrete grid current harmonic spectrum. To achieve this, the first method allows for one switching transition per phase and sampling interval, implying that a fixed modulation cycle akin to pulsewidth modulation (PWM) results. Moreover, by appropriately designing the objective function of the optimization problem underlying MPC, grid current distortions similar to those of space vector modulation (SVM) are produced. As for the second approach, two phases are allowed to switch per sampling interval, emulating the behavior of discontinuous PWM. Consequently, due to the introduced formulations, harmonic limitations imposed by relevant grid codes can be met with the proposed methods. Furthermore, due to the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nature of both approaches, all output variables of the system can be simultaneously controlled. Finally, the inherent full-state information of MPC renders an additional active damping loop unnecessary, further simplifying the controller design. The presented performance assessment highlights the potential benefits of both proposed MPC-based algorithms.},

To realize these objectives, a new coordinated control based on master--slave approach is proposed in this paper. In this method, the master source of each MG broadcasts its relative power loading as a common signal to the slave sources of the same MG and IC through a unidirectional low-bandwidth communication network. Based on this information, the slave sources and the IC adjust their operating point. The proposed method provides accurate power sharing as well as zero voltage and frequency deviation. It does not require a centralized control unit and features plug and play capability. The derivation of the proposed method is thoroughly discussed in this paper. Time domain simulation results based on CIGRE benchmark MG are presented to validate the proposed control strategy.},

Additional features of the proposed controller are summarized as follows: 1) it can be used in inverters with different output filters and is robust against their changes and uncertainties as well as the grid parameters; 2) it integrates the synchronization, which offers agile and smooth responses without causing stability issues; and 3) its structure is well suited for digital implementations. UC3 is the extension of the original single-phase work to three-phase. This paper presents the following contributions: 1) development of UC3 equations in a 2-D stationary domain; 2) derivation of a new quasi-linear model for UC3 in a GC operation; 3) a comparative stability analysis of the UC3-operated GC inverters using the developed quasi-linear model and the conventional method; 4) initial development of a new mathematical framework for the modeling and stability analysis of UC3-operated islanded inverters; and 5) comparative simulation and experimental results.},

With mismatch, either the panel-integrated diodes are bypassing the shaded panels if the string is operated at the current level of the unshaded panels, or some power of the unshaded panels is lost if the string current is reduced to the level of the shaded panels. With the implementation of dc-dc converters on panel level, the maximum available power can be extracted from each panel regardless of any mismatch.

Proposed scheme is an extension of the augmented state feedback controller with multi-oscillatory terms. Multi-resonant controllers are well-established solution for this kind of converters if high quality output voltage is needed in the presence of nonlinear loads. They take advantage of repetitiveness of the control process under the steady load conditions (this includes nonlinear and unbalanced loads). No presumption on load type entails introduction of oscillatory terms for all three voltage components with resonant frequencies up to available bandwidth dictated by technically justified switching/sampling frequency. This makes the practical implementation challenging. Our idea is to reduce number of needed oscillatory terms by adding disturbance feedforward. In the discussed system the disturbance signal is easily accessible/measurable and hence this feedback can be very effective because of lack of estimation errors. The control system is designed in dq0 reference frame rotating with the fundamental output frequency. Extensive numerical experiments indicate that the number of oscillatory terms can be reduced significantly and high quality of output voltage can be maintained.},

Our main goal is to ensure high quality voltage waveform for unbalanced and nonlinear loads. An LQR approach was chosen. The LQR design approach has proven effective in many industrial applications. Although weights in a cost function are usually set by guess and check method, the LQR in proposed system gives satisfactory results as far as some general and very intuitive rules are applied, e.g. the penalty coefficient for an integral of control error is a few orders of magnitude away from penalty coefficients related to plant state variables. In order to immunise system against nonlinear loads oscillatory terms are included in the control scheme. They can be tuned for typical harmonics like 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th. A novelty of the proposed solution lies in the fact that all controller gains (including all integral and oscillatory terms) are determined altogether in one LQR procedure call. Controls are calculated in rotating reference frame. Simulation (continuous and discrete) and experimental results (at the level of 10kW) are included. They establish consistent set of tests that validates effectiveness of the design approach.},

The DC voltage controller is a PI-type, whereas the input current is shaped by a full-state feedback controller. The novelty of the proposed solution is the control structure that has modified the DC voltage error signal by adding a discontinuity element and reduction the number of current signals by half. The discontinuity element is needed to provide a constant reference current signal during active power filtering operation. The paper describes in detail the design procedure for the voltage and current controllers. Numerical results for active rectification and active power filtering operations are presented and discussed. Numerical results have been obtained by using a discrete control model.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates (i) preplanned switching events and (ii) fault events that lead to islanding of a distribution subsystem and formation of a micro-grid. The micro-grid includes two distributed generation (DG) units. One unit is a conventional rotating synchronous machine and the other is interfaced through a power electronic converter. The interface converter of the latter unit is equipped with independent real and reactive power control to minimize islanding transients and maintain both angle stability and voltage quality within the micro-grid. The studies are performed based on a digital computer simulation approach using the PSCAD/EMTDC software package. The studies show that an appropriate control strategy for the power electronically interfaced DG unit can ensure stability of the micro-grid and maintain voltage quality at designated buses, even during islanding transients. This paper concludes that presence of an electronically-interfaced DG unit makes the concept of micro-grid a technically viable option for further investigations.},

  abstract = {The learning process and hyper-parameter optimization of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep learning (DL) architectures is considered one of the most challenging machine learning problems. Several past studies have used gradient-based back propagation methods to train DL architectures. However, gradient-based methods have major drawbacks such as stucking at local minimums in multi-objective cost functions, expensive execution time due to calculating gradient information with thousands of iterations and needing the cost functions to be continuous. Since training the ANNs and DLs is an NP-hard optimization problem, their structure and parameters optimization using the meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms has been considerably raised. MH algorithms can accurately formulate the optimal estimation of DL components (such as hyper-parameter, weights, number of layers, number of neurons, learning rate, etc.). This paper provides a comprehensive review of the optimization of ANNs and DLs using MH algorithms. In this paper, we have reviewed the latest developments in the use of MH algorithms in the DL and ANN methods, presented their disadvantages and advantages, and pointed out some research directions to fill the gaps between MHs and DL methods. Moreover, it has been explained that the evolutionary hybrid architecture still has limited applicability in the literature. Also, this paper classifies the latest MH algorithms in the literature to demonstrate their effectiveness in DL and ANN training for various applications. Most researchers tend to extend novel hybrid algorithms by combining MHs to optimize the hyper-parameters of DLs and ANNs. The development of hybrid MHs helps improving algorithms performance and capable of solving complex optimization problems. In general, the optimal performance of the MHs should be able to achieve a suitable trade-off between exploration and exploitation features. Hence, this paper tries to summarize various MH algorithms in terms of the convergence trend, exploration, exploitation, and the ability to avoid local minima. The integration of MH with DLs is expected to accelerate the training process in the coming few years. However, relevant publications in this way are still rare.},

The nonisolated topology is constructed by adding a small ac capacitor in parallel with the main inductor of the conventional buck-boost converter and replacing its semiconductor devices with the reverse-blocking switches. By using a novel control scheme, true zero-voltage switching is realized at both turn-on and turn-off of the power switches irrespective of the input voltage, output voltage, or load value. The isolated form of the converter is created by substituting the main inductor with an air-gapped high-frequency transformer, similar to the flyback converter. In this case, two smaller ac capacitors are placed on both sides of the transformer to realize soft switching as well as passive clamping; no extra clamping circuit is required. The basic operation of the proposed partial-resonant converters includes four modes and is described in detail. The comprehensive analysis of the topologies is carried out as well. Various experimental results in different operating conditions are provided to verify the performance of the proposed power converters.},

This is done by determining the shoot through duty cycle of the qZSI based on the inverter modulation index. Moreover, maintaining the MCB condition, the proposed control scheme provides a high stability margin for the qZSI network.

There are considerable numbers of review papers that are devoted to the different points of view of predictive control. However, the existing literature lacks a review study that addresses the solutions for parameter dependency of the model predictive control method. Recently, model-free predictive control has been used in drives and power electronics as a solution for dealing with the model-dependency of the model predictive control method. There are many papers that have used such methods. In this paper, a classification is proposed for the different implementation types of model-free predictive control or similar methods that address model parameter uncertainties.

In Hybrid Microgrids (HMGs), AC and DC networks are interconnected with each other through power converters. Therefore, power converters play a very important role in HMG operation, as their functionality is not only limited to interconnection but also provides power flow control and improves the power quality through different ancillary services. Moreover, due to intermittency of Renewable Energy Resources (RESs), synchronization, load variation, availability of both AC and DC networks, etc., the controllability of the power converters, power management, and protection become very complex in HMG.

  abstract = {In this paper, a soft-switching single-inductor push-pull converter is proposed. A push-pull converter is suitable for low-voltage photovoltaic ac module systems, because the step-up ratio of the high-frequency transformer is high, and the number of primary-side switches is relatively small. However, the conventional push-pull converter does not have high efficiency because of high-switching losses due to hard switching and transformer losses (copper and iron losses) as a result of the high turn ratio of the transformer. In the proposed converter, primary-side switches are turned ON at the zero-voltage switching condition and turned OFF at the zero-current switching condition through parallel resonance between the secondary leakage inductance of the transformer and a resonant capacitor. The proposed push-pull converter decreases the switching loss using soft switching of the primary switches. In addition, the turn ratio of the transformer can be reduced by half using a voltage-doubler of secondary side. The theoretical analysis of the proposed converter is verified by simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract = {European grid operators in ENTSO-E and others with a significant amount of inverter-based generation are experiencing a reduction in system inertia and short-circuit power. The changes in these key parameters are due to both an increasing number of inverter-based resources and also STATCOMS and HVDC terminals operating in a grid-following mode. Grid-forming control is a promising technology for renewable energy resources to provide appropriate grid support. However, wind energy and photovoltaic units cannot increase their active power output when operating in a maximum power point mode, as it would be needed for full grid-forming operation. Both operating at less than optimum power output or adding storage would increase the cost of generation. This article proposes extensions to the grid-forming control of inverter-based energy resources without energy storage. This would limit grid supporting nature for positive frequency or phase changes only. The proposed extensions give grid-forming control the necessary immunity to negative frequency or phase changes without the need to rely on a fast phase-locked loop or fast current control loops. This proposed control scheme has been used to evaluate the response to grid disturbances given in the ENTSO-E Phase I report of the task force grid-forming control published in April 2024.},

  abstract = {Robustness is a crucial issue in model predictive control despite the excellent dynamic performance and effective management of multiple variables that this control strategy provides for converters. This challenge is particularly concerning in solid-state dc transformers (DCT) connected as input-series-output-parallel modules because this type of DCT not only regulates the output voltage/power but also balances the input voltage so that the power is averagely distributed among submodules. Static errors and limited dynamics pose a threat to their operation and even safety. To tackle this issue, this article proposes a novel model-free predictive control based on an autoregressive moving average structure. Herein, the physical model of DCTs is completely replaced by a data-driven model. Combined with the recursive least square method with the forgetting factor, the control system will no longer rely on the electrical parameters, guaranteeing strong robustness. Meanwhile, an adaptive balance controller is also proposed, which adjusts the gain of shift angles with reduced computational burden. These achieve accurate power/voltage allocation among all submodules while maintaining a fast dynamic response. The experimental comparisons with other schemes verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

In order to take advantage of this capability, this article presents a decentralized model predictive control scheme, which includes HDTs in the active distribution network (ADN) voltage control. This scheme employs a fully decentralized architecture, in which each HDT is controlled by a local robust MPC (RMPC). Each local RMPC, based solely on local measurements, computes the optimal reactive power reference for its associated HDT. The optimization aims at correcting abnormal voltages and reducing reactive power injection/absorption. By doing so, this scheme achieves both objectives of ADN voltage regulation and control effort minimization. The salient feature of this scheme is that, by regarding the interactions among HDTs as disturbances and compensating them using tube-based robust method, it achieves a suboptimal control of ADN bus voltages without communication among HDTs. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

Alternatively, partial power dc--dc converters (PPCs) process only a portion of the full power to achieve MPPT. Other goals of PPCs are a higher efficiency, a higher power density, and a lower overall cost compared to FPCs (e.g., by using lower voltage class and/or lower current semiconductors). The flyback PPC topology shows that efficiency can be improved by 1\% in comparison to FPCs. However, the use of transformers with large self-inductance tends to increase the volume. An alternative architecture is proposed in this work based on a series resonant converter (SRC). The addition of this partial power SRC stage pays off in terms of current ripple mitigation, reduced volume, and high efficiency.

  abstract = {Microgrids (MGs) interest is growing very fast due to the environment urgency and their capability to integrate renewable energy in a flexible way. In particular, islanded MGs in which distributed energy resources (DERs) are connected to the infrastructure with power electronic converters have attracted the interest of many researchers of both academia and industry because management, control and protection of such systems is quite different from the case of traditional networks. According to their operation mode, MGs that power electronic converters can be divided into grid-forming, grid-feeding and grid-supporting inverters. In particular, grid forming inverters are asked to impose voltage and frequency in the MG. This paper aims to propose a model predictive control (MPC) based approach for grid-forming inverters in an islanded MG. The MPC strategy is implemented because of its capability to define the optimal control actions that contemporarily track the desired reference signals and accounts for equality and inequality constraints. The overall problem formulation (objective function and relevant constraints) is described step by step and considers the specificity of the considered DC source. The proposed approach allows for the obtaining of very good results in terms of readiness against disturbances, even if it requires being fed only by local measurements. In order to validate the developed method, this paper proposes an experimental validation of the designed MPC controller in order to show its correct operation on a real system in a power hardware in the loop set-up using a rapid control prototyping approach.},

To enhance the fault ride-through (FRT) capability of DFIG and improve the converter capacity utilization, this paper proposes a novel DFIG-based WECS using a dynamic reconfiguration hybrid interlinking transformer (DR-HIT) technique for performance improvement under grid faults. Multiple operating modes and flexible switching strategies were developed based on the analysis of the proposed topology and principles. The proposed DR-HIT approach smooths the DFIG 's output power fluctuations through the cooperative control of the multifunctional converter (MFC) and grid-side converter (GSC) in shunt mode when the grid voltage is stable. Upon the occurrence of a grid voltage fault, the DR-HIT flexibly switches from shunt mode to series mode, maintaining the terminal voltage at a constant value. Additionally, once grid voltage recovers, the DR-HIT reverts flexibly to its shunt mode. Finally, simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve accurate control of the system and flexible switching between different modes.},

Such disruptions endanger the safe operation of the power system. This paper proposes a novel topology for DFIG-based WTG by integrating a hybrid interlinking transformer (HIT) and energy storage system. The proposed HIT-DFIG system consists of a grid-side converter, rotor-side converter, series converter (SEC), HIT, and direct current energy storage system (DC-ESS). The proposed HIT-DFIG actively adjusts the voltage of the series winding through SEC, achieving active support for the DFIG terminal voltage under grid fault conditions. The DC-ESS provides power support for HIT during the FRT period and has a power smoothing function. Subsequently, the operating principle, and mathematical modeling of HIT-DFIG are analyzed to demonstrate the function of series voltage regulation of HIT. Then, a simplified FRT control strategy is presented, purposed to enhance the low/high/harmonic voltages ride-through capability of DFIG during grid fault scenarios. Finally, the performance of the proposed HIT-DFIG, under diverse operating circumstances such as symmetric and asymmetric grid faults, was verified through simulation and experiments.},

This paper compares several performance aspects of the two methods when they are implemented on a FPGA for MPC applications. We compare the computational complexity, storage, convergence speed, and some practical implementation issues. We find that, in general, ASM gives lower complexity and converges faster when the numbers of decision variables and constraints are small. Otherwise, IPM should be a better choice due to its scalability. We also note occasional instability of both IPM and ASM when they are implemented in our FPGA, which uses single precision floating point arithmetic. The instability is mainly due to numerical error, which is found to be more serious in ASM than IPM in our current implementations.},

Intermittent output power of a renewable generation causes voltage deviation. For voltage regulation, P-Q droop has considerable effect. The calculation of P-Q droop coefficients is based on the voltage sensitivity value derived by Jacobian matrix. To achieve the desired P-Q droop coefficient, it is necessary to reflect active power-frequency (P-f) and reactive power-voltage magnitude (Q-V) droop scheme widely used in an islanded microgrid. The P-f droop characteristic is applied by regarding the renewable generator as a slack bus and the Q-V droop characteristic is applied by adding the additional term to Jacobian matrix.

The high voltage gain can be achieved by the SC networks without an extremely large duty cycle, and the voltage stresses of all the active switches and diodes are kept at levels much lower than the output voltage. Compared with the traditional SC converters, the proposed converter can achieve continuous voltage regulation by the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) technique. The interleaving operation can reduce the input current ripple and improve the power capacity. Resonant inductors with small inductances are inserted into the SC networks to avoid the high current spikes that occur in the traditional SC converters. All the active switches can achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS) turn-on. Some of the diodes can achieve zero-current switching (ZCS) turn-off, and the other diodes achieve reduced turn-off di/dt rates. The operating principle and essential steady-state characteristics of the converter are analyzed in detail. Finally, a prototype converter with an input voltage of 25-40 V, an output voltage of 400 V, and a rated power of 1 kW is designed and implemented to verify the theoretical analysis.},

First, a novel SoC-based adaptive droop control is designed for the combined ESS to provide dc bus voltage support and ac bus frequency support, and the lifetime of the combined ESS is extended because the overcharge and overdischarge can be avoided. Second, ac bus frequency and dc bus voltage are regarded as global parameters to enforce the power interaction between ac and dc subgrids. The power interactions between ac and dc subgrids can be proportionally allocated with the coordination coefficients to avoid an over-used BILC. Furthermore, the proposed distributed coordinated power control (DCPC) for BILCs network has plug-and-play capacity and allows an acceptable communication time delay and communication link failures. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed coordination control strategy applied into the novel hybrid ac/dc MG system is verified by the real-time hardware-in-loop (HIL) tests.},

This paper proposes a distributed dynamic event-triggered control (ETC) strategy for the HMG to realize the global economic operation. In each subgrid, economic power sharing (EPS) among DGs can be achieved by economic droop controllers with no global information. The proposed distributed dynamic ETC includes a continuous-time part and a discrete-time part, where the former part realizes the EPI between two subgrids, while the latter part ensures the proportional power sharing between BILCs. Thus, a particular over-stressed BILC can be avoided, and system reliability and scalability are significantly improved. Additionally, only data from neighboring BILCs at the event-triggered times are involved, which greatly minimizes the communication burden and costamong BILCs. Furthermore, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system dynamics and the communication time delay stability are proven. Finally, the hardware-in-loop experimental results are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

However, existing full feedforward strategies are complex and control delay cannot be compensated precisely, which leads to the instability of system when the full feedforward of the voltage at the point of common coupling under the weak grid is adopted. This article first proposes a simplified full feedforward strategy based on grid-side inductor volt-age differential feedback active damping (GIVD-AD). Second, repetitive prediction (RP) is used to compensate for the control delay. Then, a virtual impedance branch is added and an adaptive algorithm for modifying virtual impedance based on the difference between predicted grid voltages by Newton interpolation prediction (NIP) and RP is proposed. With the proposed method, grid-connected inverters can work stably when grid impedance changes suddenly and exhibit strong rejection ability against grid-voltage harmonics. Finally, simulative and experimental results from a 3-kW single-phase grid-connected inverter are provided to prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a power regulation strategy for a bidirectional interlinking converter (BIC) in a hybrid AC/DC microgrid. The proposed control strategy utilizes grid forming virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control of BIC to achieve global power sharing (GPS) between two sub-grids, AC and DC sub-grids, in islanded mode. Both grid-connected mode and islanded mode are incorporated in the system. This approach allows BIC to operate under a voltage source fault in the AC subgrid. The control strategy includes both communication-based and communication-less approaches to handle communication equipment failures. In the DC-side, a droop shift control strategy is proposed, taking into account the energy storage system (ESS) and its management with the virtual output power method. Simultaneously, the droop shift control can increase the load response in the DC side of BIC. During periods of low load demand, the ESS can be charged, and the overall power sharing on the AC and DC sides can be achieved. In addition, this study combines virtual impedance and frequency restoration control of BIC to enhance active and reactive power sharing. Furthermore, the system stability is analyzed. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified through simulations and prototype experimental results.},

  abstract = {Performance of LLC resonant converters (RC), such as zero-voltage switching (ZVS) characteristic, heavily depends on control of the oscillation circuit. It is thus crucial to understand how the system behavior varies with different working conditions and tune the controller accordingly. In this article, a system identification method and an H{$\infty$} mixed sensitivity control strategy are proposed for LLC RC against parameter perturbations. Frequency response is derived through correlation analysis from the input- and the output signals by injecting a pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS) to the control input of the resonant converter. The eigen-system realization algorithm is used to acquire a parametric model. The proposed identification approach enjoys low complexity, and an accurate model of LLC RC can be obtained. The frequency response to different parameter perturbations is investigated to obtain bound of system uncertainties. This way a model-based, precise control synthesis is facilitated. An optimal controller is obtained through H{$\infty$} mixed sensitivity design, which can effectively improve the robustness and dynamic performance of system. Finally, an in-house built prototype is used to verify feasibility of the proposed identification and control schemes. The converter features satisfactory voltage regulation capability and fast dynamic performance. ZVS over a wide range is approached, too.},

In order to improve the system robustness against the parameter mismatches and disturbances, an improved direct model predictive current control with a disturbance observer is proposed in this article, where the disturbance observer is realized by an incremental moving horizon estimator. Moreover, another concern raised from the applications of direct model predictive current control is the computational burden, especially for the long-horizon implementations. Therefore, a dual reference frame solution for the surface permanent-magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM) is proposed in this article to allocate a great proportion of heavy computations required for the optimization problem to the offline preparation, which can reduce the computational burden by almost 50\% on average for a prediction horizon of five time-steps. Besides, the parameter mismatch effects of individual electrical parameters on the control performance of the model predictive direct current control method are investigated and quantified via simulations. A five-step direct model predictive current control is implemented on a dSPACE system with a sampling frequency of 20 kHz to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with an SPMSM drive system.},

Conventionally, proportional integral and proportional resonant-based control strategies are applied to control the output power or current of a GFC. But, those control strategies have poor transient performance and are not robust against uncertainties and volatilities in the system. This paper proposes a H2/H{$\infty$}-based control strategy, which can mitigate the above restrictions. The uncertainty and disturbance are included to formulate the GFC system state-space model, making it more accurate to reflect the practical system conditions. The paper uses a convex optimisation method to design the H2/H{$\infty$}-based optimal controller. Instead of using a guess-and-check method, the paper uses particle swarm optimisation to search a H2/H{$\infty$} optimal controller. Several case studies implemented by both simulation and experiment can verify the superiority of the proposed control strategy than the traditional PI control methods especially under dynamic and variable system conditions.},

One of the major challenges in the control and operation of microgrids is managing the fluctuating renewable energy generation, as well as sudden load changes that can affect system frequency and voltage stability. To solve the above problems, hierarchical control techniques have received wide attention. At present, although some progress has been made in hierarchical control systems using classical control, machine learning-based approaches have shown promising features and performance in the control and operation management of microgrids. This paper reviews not only the application of classical control in hierarchical control systems in the last five years of references, but also the application of machine learning techniques. The survey also provides a comprehensive description of the use of different machine learning algorithms at different control levels, with a comparative analysis for their control methods, advantages and disadvantages, and implementation methods from multiple perspectives. The paper also presents the structure of primary and secondary control applications utilizing machine learning technology. In conclusion, it is highlighted that machine learning in microgrid hierarchical control can enhance control accuracy and address system optimization concerns. However, challenges, such as computational intensity, the need for stability analysis, and experimental validation, remain to be addressed.},

In order to maximize the development of distribution substations, this paper proposes a high-frequency isolated hybrid distribution transformer, which has functions of comprehensive power quality control and AC/DC hybrid distribution, and can meet the high-quality power supply and friendly connection requirements of new sources/load for distribution terminal users. Firstly, the topology structure of the high-frequency isolated hybrid distribution transformer is introduced and the mathematical model is derived. Then, based on the characteristics of the topology structure, continuous-set model predictive control (CCS-MPC) strategy and delayed MPC control strategy are designed to calculate the optimal duty cycle and achieve output with fixed switching frequency and switching sequence, reducing the optimization computation. Finally, a 10kV/0.4kV full power level high-frequency isolated hybrid distribution transformer system is built using MATLAB/Simulink simulation software to verify the effectiveness of the proposed topology structure in comprehensive power quality control.},

  abstract = {Car-following control is a fundamental application of autonomous driving. This control has multiple objectives, including tracking a safe distance to a preceding vehicle and enhancing driving comfort. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful method due to its intuitiveness and capability to cover multiple objectives. MPC determines the relative importance of objectives through a set of weight factors, depending on which, the controller's behavior changes even if the traffic situations are the same. However, determining the optimal weight is not a trivial problem because there is no benchmark to evaluate the performance of the weight, and searching for weight factors with repeated driving experiments is time-consuming. To solve this problem, we proposed an automatic tuning method to determine the weights of the MPC based on personal driving data. Personal driving data under naturalistic driving conditions provide car-following situations and driver's behaviors. These data can generate a reference model to represent the driver's driving style. Based on this model, the proposed method defined the automatic tuning problem as an optimization problem that minimizes the difference between the reference and the controller's response using the optimal weight factors. This optimization problem was solved using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The proposed method was implemented with an embedded optimization coder in an offline fashion. Its performance was evaluated using personal driving data. From this, the proposed method can reduce the effort and time required for an engineer to find the optimal weight factors.},

Bilateral inertia sharing (BIS) control strategy, which can simultaneously mitigate DC voltage and AC frequency variations, is applied to hybrid AC/DC MGs to enhance the dynamic responses of the entire system. The bidirectional interlinking converter (BIC) enables mutual sharing of inertia in both directions within hybrid AC/DC microgrids. However, a quantitative analysis or modeling method for BIS control strategy has not been yet investigated in literatures. To fill up this gap, a systematic analysis framework of bilateral inertia through a dynamic circuit model (DCM) is proposed in this paper. In the framework, load disturbances, frequency, voltage deviations, and inertia emulation control across the hybrid system are represented by circuit quantities. DC and AC subgrids integrated with virtual inertia control (VIC) are modeled as dynamic Thevenin's equivalent circuits. Thanks to the bidirectional power transfer by BIC under normalization control, the two circuits can be connected in parallel, which characterizes a complete dynamic circuit model that helps to quantify the inertia transferred between the two subgrids. The feasibility of proposed framework is verified by Bode diagrams in frequency domain and time domain simulations.},

  abstract = {In order to meet the demand for high-voltage architectures of 400 V and 800 V in electric vehicle systems, high-power DC-DC converters have become a key focus of research. The Four-Switch Buck--Boost converter has gained widespread application due to its wide voltage conversion range, consistent input and output polarity, and the capability of bidirectional power transfer. This paper focuses on the energy conversion requirements in high-voltage scenarios for electric vehicles, analyzing the working principle of this converter and typical control strategies. It summarizes the issues encountered under different control strategies and presents improvements. Hard-switching multi-mode control strategies aim to improve control algorithms and logic to mitigate large duty cycle variations and voltage gain discontinuities caused by dead zones. For control strategies based on controlling the inductor current to achieve soft-switching, the discussion mainly focuses on optimizing the implementation of soft-switching, reducing overall system losses, and improving the computation speed. Finally, the paper summarizes FSBB control strategies and outlines future directions, providing theoretical support for high-voltage fast charging and onboard power supplies in electric vehicles.},

  abstract = {As the hub of the alternating current (AC) submicrogrid and direct current (DC) sub-microgrid connection, the interlinking converter is responsible for the important tasks of power transmission within the AC and DC sub-microgrids. The quality of its control strategy is directly related to the AC/DC hybrid microgrid stable operation. In this paper, the droop control equations adopted by the distributed sources connected to the AC sub-microgrid and the DC sub-microgrid is analyzed in detail. Furthermore, a bidirectional droop control strategy for interlinking converters based on PI control is proposed to realize the power balance of isolated hybrid microgrids. This strategy considers the characteristics of interlinking converters that need to maintain AC bus frequency and DC bus voltage stability and power bidirectional transmission. Mutual power support between AC and DC subsystems can reduce the impact of the deviation of the individual subsystem from the rated operating conditions on the remaining subsystems. Finally, a simulation model of the AC/DC hybrid microgrid is built in MATLAB/Simulink to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract = {The photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected power system in the residential applications is becoming a fast growing segment in the PV market due to the shortage of the fossil fuel energy and the great environmental pollution. A new research trend in the residential generation system is to employ the PV parallel-connected configuration rather than the series-connected configuration to satisfy the safety requirements and to make full use of the PV generated power. How to achieve high-step-up, low-cost, and high-efficiency dc/dc conversion is the major consideration due to the low PV output voltage with the parallel-connected structure. The limitations of the conventional boost converters in these applications are analyzed. Then, most of the topologies with high-step-up, low-cost, and high-efficiency performance are covered and classified into several categories. The advantages and disadvantages of these converters are discussed. Furthermore, a general conceptual circuit for high-step-up, low-cost, and high-efficiency dc/dc conversion is proposed to derive the next-generation topologies for the PV grid-connected power system. Finally, the major challenges of high-step-up, low-cost, and high-efficiency dc/dc converters are summarized. This paper would like to make a clear picture on the general law and framework for the next-generation nonisolated high-step-up dc/dc converters.},

  abstract = {Voltage source inverters connected to the grid in applications such as active rectifiers, active filters, uninterruptible power supplies, and distributed generation systems need an optimal ac current control. To obtain zero steady-state error at the fundamental frequency (i.e., unity power factor), the use of a standard integrator in a rotating frame is as effective as the use of a resonant controller in a stationary frame. However, the grid voltage harmonics influence the current controller and generate current harmonics unless several integrators in multiple rotating frames or resonant compensators in a stationary frame are adopted. In this letter, a hybrid system consisting of a proportional integral (PI) controller plus a generic hth harmonic resonant controller implemented in a frame rotating at the n th harmonic frequency is discussed in detail. The hth harmonic controller is able to decrease both the (h - n)th and (h + n)th harmonics, while the PI controller is able to decrease other harmonics if the synchronization phase signal adopted for the frame transformation is unfiltered. It is demonstrated that the use of a PI and sixth harmonic resonant compensator is effective for both positive and negative sequence fifth and seventh harmonics; hence, four harmonics are compensated with the proportional integral-resonant (PI-RES) controller implemented in a synchronous frame. Simulation and experimental tests validate the proposed analysis},

An example LCL filter design is reported and a filter has been built and tested using the values obtained from this design. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of the design procedure both for the LCL filter and for the rectifier controller. The system is stable and the grid current harmonic content is low both in the lowand high-frequency ranges. Moreover, the good agreement that was obtained between simulation and experimental results validates the proposed approach. Hence, the design procedure and the simulation model provide a powerful tool to design an LCL-filter-based active rectifier while avoiding trial-and-error procedures that can result in having to build several filter prototypes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a multifunctional control system for interlinking converters interfacing microgrids and ac mains. Applicable standards pose power quality and grid-support function requirements for converters that interface energy resources of dc nature with an ac utility grid. At the same time, the forthcoming smart grid scenario calls for additional functionalities, enabling the effective integration of hybrid (i.e., dc or ac) microgrids, that are applicable to both grid-connected and islanded modes of operation. This requires novel interlinking converter controllers with extended flexibility. The control system described in this paper fulfills both connected and islanded operation needs and provides seamless transitions between the two modes. Such valuable functionalities are attained owing to an underlying, large-bandwidth, triple-loop control organization. The target converter is meant to be connected to a local dc subgrid at the dc side and to a local ac subgrid at the ac side. The controller manages the connection of the ac-side subgrid with the utility grid, ensuring a fast response control of the ac grid current. Therefore, it allows interfacing of renewable sources and loads, aggregated in dc and ac nanogrids or microgrids, with smart power systems, providing enhanced power quality, stability, and flexibility of operation.},

However, when both input and output voltage ranges are wide, the three-dimensional (3-D) look-up table (LUT) with huge data quantity or the switching frequency with wide variation range is typically required in previous schemes.

In addition, ZVS conditions, which are accurate and simple, are derived to facilitate the minimization of rms inductor current.

Energy storage (ES) units are one solution to improve power supply quality and guarantee system stability. In this paper, a hybrid microgrid is built based on photovoltaic (PV) generator and ES; and coordinated control is proposed and developed to achieve power management in a decentralized manner. This control scheme contains three different droop strategies according to characteristics of PV and ES. First, the modified droop control is proposed for PV, which can take full utilization of renewable energy and avoid regulating output active power frequently. Second, to maintain the direct current (DC) bus voltage stability, a novel droop control incorporating a constant power band is presented for DC-side ES. Third, a cascade droop control is designed for alternating current (AC)-side ES. Thus, the ES lifetime is prolonged. Moreover, interlinking converters (ICs) provide a bridge between AC/DC buses in a hybrid microgrid. The power control of IC is enabled when the AC- or DC-side suffer from active power demand shortage. In particular, if the AC microgrid does not satisfy the reactive power demand, IC then acts as a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM). The effectiveness of the proposed strategies is verified by simulations.},

Model-based control is widely used in converters due to its ease, but it poses challenges when dealing with inaccurate models, critical loads, and multidisturbances. To fix them, this work proposes a data-driven model-free adaptive control (MFAC) for a 3L-NPC power converter system to realize robust, high-quality current and voltage control without any system parameters. Specifically, an MFAC is a potential method for estimating the system dynamics by designing adaptive laws derived intuitively from Lyapunov theory to regulate current and voltage, guaranteeing self-adaptability to unmodeled dynamics, model variations, parameter mismatches, and disturbances. Striving for easier access to adaptive law gains, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is embedded in MFAC to automatically determine them utilizing the fitness function defined by the voltage and current.

Based on the derived dynamic models related to the dc-link of HDT, this article reveals that the dc component of the load currents, modulating dc bias, sampling dc bias, and the capacitors parameters derivation are the main factors leading to the voltages unbalancing, and the active control of the grid currents' zero-sequence component is a simple and key method to eliminating this unbalance. To address these, the split capacitors' voltage balancing control strategy with proportional-integral (PI) controller is developed. To eliminate the static error and improve the system's dynamic performance, the quasi-resonant regulators and load-neutral current feed-forward are added to the PI controller, thus formulating a novel controller. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed novel control strategy.},

There are two degrees of modulation freedom in the PCCM ZVS modulation scheme. The previous schemes typically only optimize one of them to reduce root mean square (rms) inductor current, which results in relatively lower efficiency in the condition when the difference between input voltage and output voltage is large. In this article, a multi-frequency PCCM ZVS modulation scheme is proposed for the FSBB converter with wide input and output voltage ranges. By optimizing both of the two degrees of modulation freedom to reduce rms inductor current, the heavy-load efficiency can be effectively improved when the difference between input voltage and output voltage is large. Thus, the overall efficiency of the FSBB converter can be optimized. A 1500-W FSBB prototype with input and output voltage ranges of 200--400V is built to verify the proposed modulation scheme.},

  abstract = {The partial power processing (PPP) concept has been extensively employed in many two-port converters to achieve high efficiency and high-power density by modifying one of the original converter ports to be connected in series between input and output. This is attractive but is confined to two-port applications, and how to extend it to multiport applications is not clear. Hence, this article aims to explore a generalized PPP multiport scheme by arranging the connection of the module rather than the converter. For a PPP single-input(output)-N-outputs(inputs) converter, one terminal of all N+1 modules is connected together to construct a radial structure, and another terminal is series/parallel connected with the input/output port. Each module only needs to process partial power caused by the voltage or current difference between input and output. Therefore, the required power rating of components is effectively reduced, contributing to low cost as well as low power loss. In this article, a PPP single-input dual-output converter with active bridge modules is also taken as an example to be introduced in detail, designed and experimented upon, which validates that high efficiency and high-power density can be achieved.},

This is adverse for its introduction into buck-boost applications. Previous authors have realised buck-boost conversion by adding extra switches to make the conversion module bi-polar. Nevertheless, when the output voltage changes between buck and boost, the voltage gain of the conversion modules is required to have a wide range, which can result in a large degradation of the conversion performance. To avoid polarity reversal and a wide voltage gain range of the conversion module, we propose a novel PPP buck-boost dc-dc converter with a T-shaped module connection. Each branch of the T is equipped with one conversion module. By regulating the middle module voltage, whenever the output voltage changes, the voltage gains can be limited to a relatively narrow range, ensuring high performance. In this paper, the triple active bridge is chosen for the conversion modules. The corresponding analysis and simulation results will be demonstrated based on an example application of 350V input to 320V-380V output.},

In GFM plants implemented by multiple virtual synchronous generators (VSGs), these performance aspects are dominated by VSGs' active power control (APC) parameters, i.e., the inertia constant H and damping coefficient D. However, an APC parameter design with these performance aspects comprehensively considered remains unexplored, potentially leading to inappropriate P-f droop, underdamped LFOs, or excessive APST bandwidth. To address this issue, first, by separating the multi-VSG system's active power responses into a common part and a differential part, the analytical expressions for its LFO damping ratio and APST bandwidth are derived. Second, by aligning these performance aspects with the requirements outlined in representative GFM plant guidelines, a systematic APC parameter design method is proposed. This method explicitly formulates the feasible region for the APC parameters that ensures appropriate P-f droop, LFO damping, and APST bandwidth. Finally, real-time simulations and experiments are conducted in various multi-VSG systems to validate the theoretical analysis and the proposed APC parameter design method.},

This article proposes a novel soft-start strategy that eliminates the need for bypassing the series converter, thus simplifying the conventional approach. Modeling analysis indicates that, during the uncontrolled rectification stage, the unbypassed soft-start strategy allows both the series and shunt converters of the HDT to charge their dc-link capacitors simultaneously, maintaining approximately fixed current ratio and voltage ratio. In the pulsewidth modulation rectification stage, sequentially enabling the closed-loop control of shunt and series converters allows the dc-link capacitors to be further charged to their rated voltage. The key innovation lies in the slight delay enablement of the series converter and the PI parameters-varying control, which can effectively suppress the inrush current owing to the weak controllability of the shunt converter and the windings voltage change during the switchover period. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed unbypassed soft-start strategy, whether using constant or ramped dc-link voltage references.},

The desired operating features of the hybrid microgrid can then be added through this interlinking converter. To demonstrate, an appropriate control scheme is now developed for controlling the interlinking converter. The objective is to keep the hybrid microgrid in autonomous operation with active power proportionally shared among its distributed sources. Power sharing here should depend only on the source ratings and not their placements within the hybrid microgrid. The proposed scheme can also be extended to include energy storage within the interlinking converter, as already proven in simulation and experiment. These findings have not been previously discussed in the literature, where existing schemes are mostly for an ac or a dc microgrid, but not both in coexistence.},

  abstract = {Certain modern power electronics systems require active regulation of the split DC bus capacitor voltages. The series resonant converter is suitable to be utilized as an active voltage regulator, due to its ability to operate with soft switching, and hence, with high efficiency. In discontinuous conduction mode, the series resonant converter operates with a constant unity voltage gain, thus achieving balancing of the DC link. However, discontinuous conduction mode does not provide means for achieving a different voltage distribution, which is important in many scenarios. On the other hand, by operating in quantum mode (i.e. type 2 discontinuous conduction mode), the voltages across DC bus capacitor can be regulated. Therefore, the modeling of the quantum mode series resonant converter connected across split DC bus is presented in this paper. The steady-state operation as well as transient behavior are discussed and experimentally verified on a laboratory prototype.},

To demonstrate that this connection structure allows new combinations, in this article a new single switch and asymmetric topology is proposed based on the differential connection. This topology is based on a boost converter with a coupled inductor and a voltage multiplier cell. Even with a low number of components, the proposed converter has high-voltage gain, the components present low voltage and current stress. To demonstrate that the converter has good performance, two prototypes were built considering different values of the duty cycle and turns ratio of coupled inductor. From there, the maximum efficiency achieved is 97.5\% at 200 W.},

While MPC requires the online solution of an optimization problem, its ability to handle multivariable systems and constraints makes it a very powerful control strategy specially for MPC of embedded systems, which have an ever increasing amount of sensing and computation capabilities. We argue that the implementation of MPC on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) using automatic tools is nowadays possible, achieving cost-effective successful applications on fast or resource-constrained systems. The main burden for the implementation of MPC on FPGAs is the challenging design of the necessary algorithms. We outline an approach to achieve a software-supported optimized implementation of MPC on FPGAs using high-level synthesis tools and automatic code generation. The proposed strategy exploits the arithmetic operations necessaries to solve optimization problems to tailor an FPGA design, which allows a tradeoff between energy, memory requirements, cost, and achievable speed. We show the capabilities and the simplicity of use of the proposed methodology on two different examples and illustrate its advantages over a microcontroller implementation.},

To address the problem of limited stability and frequent oscillations, this paper proposes a state feedback control method for the AC/DC converter. Conventional AC/DC converter adopts the voltage-current double-closed-loop control structure with the proportional-integral (PI) controllers, which is the equivalent of the typical type II control system, but the typical type II control system cannot fully settle the stability and immunity problems. In contrast, the state feedback control strategy not only achieves the control objectives of the traditional double-closed-loop control but also reduces the AC/DC converter system model to a typical Type I system, which improves stability and thus enhances the oscillation suppression capability of the bus voltage. By selecting multiple state variables and designing the converter pole configuration range, the proposed single-loop state feedback control method manages to optimize both the dynamic and steady-state performances of the grid-connected AC/DC converter. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed single-loop state feedback control strategy is verified through MATLAB (2018b)/Simulink software simulation and experiments on a DC distribution network platform.},

However, when the load voltage fluctuates, if the load voltage is fully compensated to meet the condition that the load voltage is equal to the rated voltage, HDT requires a larger compensation capacity and higher design cost. The output capacity of HDT is affected by multiple degrees of freedom, and the optimal output capacity cannot be obtained according to the traditional analytical formula. In order to obtain the optimal output capacity of HDT, this paper proposes a HDT voltage partial compensation strategy based on the SA-PSO algorithm. By analysing the relationship between load and voltage regulation adjustment, the optimal working point is found by the SA-PSO optimization algorithm. The proposed compensation strategy reduces the compensation capacity required by HDT, thereby reducing the design cost.

  abstract = {The electric motor is a device that converts electrical power into mechanical power. The DC motor has some advantages compared to the AC motor on its easier way to control the speed or position and wide adjustable range. However, it still has some issues, such as uncertainty and disturbance; most existing controllers still provide bad system performance or have major drawbacks in solving these issues. The alternative solution for a control method with simple, easy to design, and can be implemented in a multi-input multi-output system is the integral state feedback control technique, such as in Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). The weakness of LQR control is that there is no exact method to determine the best value of matrix Q and R used to calculate the state feedback gain; trial or manual tuning method is mostly used. Therefore, this paper proposed an improved LQR control using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method and the Kalman filter estimator. The PSO was used to find optimal Q and R-value, while the Kalman filter reduced the number of sensors used to measure the system state. Both performance and energy consumption were compared using the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE) and total energy consumption. The simulation results showed that the proposed method is superior in performance and energy compared to manually-tuned LQR. However, based on the hardware implementation, although the manually-tuned LQR was found to have the smallest energy consumption, the proposed method has the smallest IAE, which can reduce the IAE by 11.28\% with only 1\% higher energy compared to manually-tuned LQR.},

For a given minimum ON-time and, consequently, for a given minimum duty ratio D/sub min/, D/sup 2/ in the numerator of M(D) yields a much lower limit on the minimum attainable conversion ratio. By applying a systematic synthesis procedure, six novel single-transistor converter configurations with quadratic DC conversion ratios are found. The simpler, single-transistor realization is the most important advantage over the straightforward cascade of two basic converters. As far as conversion efficiency is concerned, it is clear that a single-stage converter is usually a better choice than a two-stage converter. The quadratic converters proposed are intended for applications where conventional single-stage converters are inadequate-for high-frequency applications where the specified range of input voltages and the specified range of output voltages call for an extremely large range of conversion ratios.{$<>$}},

The existence of both AC and DC microgrids has led to a new concept of hybrid AC/DC microgrid which consists of both AC and DC grids tied by an interlinking converter (ILC). Such hybrid AC/DC microgrid has the advantages of both AC and DC with increased efficiency and less cost since the conversion between AC and DC is reduced. The management of power in such a grid becomes important for voltage and frequency control. Different voltage and frequency control strategies have been successfully implemented within AC and DC grids, but the control of hybrid microgrid requires further attention with focus on ILC. This study presents an overview of various control schemes used for voltage and frequency regulation in standalone and transition mode operation of hybrid microgrid. A detailed study on hybrid grid structure is presented with different modes of operation. Various ILC strategies based on droop and communication-based control are presented.

Various control schemes of ILC have been discussed in literature but there is a lack of a generalized, autonomous control which considers the tie line capacity between ac and dc grids. In addition, the majority of schemes involve switching between control modes which increases power losses. To address these issues, this paper presents a generalized droop scheme of ILC for power sharing and control in a standalone hybrid ac/dc microgrid. A 3-dimensional plane is proposed where the axis correspond to dc voltage, ac frequency and converter power. The converter utilizes frequency droop at ac terminal and voltage droop at dc terminal so any change in voltage or frequency results in active power flow from an underloaded to overloaded grid. A corresponding mathematical model is also presented which determines the impact of load change on frequency and dc voltage. The proposed scheme enables autonomous power transfer in both directions without any form of communication. A comparison between the traditional normalization scheme and proposed scheme is also presented where it is observed that this method reduces the frequency deviations and transient response time, thereby giving a better performance. Both the simulations and experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed model.},

The impact of the droop gains on the stability is discussed and an operational range is defined for a stable system operation. Second, contrary to previous literature which have modeled the ac and dc grids by ideal sources and converters, the ac grid in this scheme is represented as a second-order synchronous generator and the dc grid is modeled as a PV system so as to analyze the dc grid dynamics in detail. It is observed that the dc link capacitor and inductor filter can lead to large system oscillations which can compromise stability. Third, the stability of the hybrid grid is analyzed from the aspect of short circuit ratio (SCR). Both rectifier and inverter mode of operation are used to understand how stability is affected with strength of ac grid. The time-domain simulations in PSCAD are used to confirm the validity of results obtained in frequency domain.},

  abstract = {Hybrid microgrid continues to be an attraction for researchers as it brings the advantages of both ac and dc systems under one roof. The interlinking converter (ILC) of this system regulates the ac frequency and dc voltage while maintaining bidirectional power. This paper proposes a novel solidstate transformer (SST) based topology for interconnected medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) hybrid microgrids. Based on the topology, various control modes are identified and correspondingly, an autonomous power sharing scheme is presented with dc voltage and ac frequency regulation. A linear voltage-frequency control is discussed for ac/dc and dc/ac converters of SST which provides a secondary control mechanism. The dual active bridge (DAB) of the SST operates at voltage control mode while providing electrical isolation and stable system operation. The proposed topology and control scheme is significant in the sense that it allows integration of ac and dc grids with different voltage and frequency levels. In addition, the secondary dc voltage or ac frequency regulation control at any hybrid microgrid automatically regulates the ac frequency and dc voltage in the system which reduces system cost. Various simulated scenarios in PSCAD with load changes highlight the optimal performance of the proposed scheme.},

This type of interconnected converter system can be commonly seen in a stand-alone microgrid and some advanced testing benches for power electronics converters. In this article, a system consisting of a voltage-controlled converter with LC filter and a current-controlled converter with LCL filter have been studied. A detailed mathematical model is proposed to describe the stability and coupling characteristics of such system. It is found that the stability problem in this type of configuration may arise in an uncommon way, which is different from the typical resonance in a grid-connected converter system and can be triggered in higher frequency band. Meanwhile, the voltage and current behaviors of interconnected converters are strongly coupled through the complicated filter impedances and control loops in low-frequency band and mid-frequency band.},

  abstract = {Hybrid Distribution Transformers (HDTs) offer a compelling alternative to traditional low-frequency transformers (LFTs), providing auxiliary services in addition to standard functionalities. By integrating LFTs with power converters, HDTs enhance the operational capabilities of the system. The specific configuration in which converters are connected to the transformer allows for the provision of multiple services. This can not only prevent network failures but also extend the lifespan of its components, an outcome that is highly desirable in a distribution grid. This article discusses an HDT developed to mitigate voltage fluctuations in the grid and to decrease the reactive power drawn from the secondary side of traditional LFTs. A finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC), in conjunction with linear controllers, is utilized for the effective management of the HDT converters. Two separate control loops are established to regulate voltage and reactive power on the secondary side of the transformer. Results from Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing affirm the proficiency of HDT in reducing grid voltage variations by 15\% and in cutting reactive power consumption by up to 94\%. The adopted control strategy and topology are demonstrated to be effective in stabilizing voltage and reactive power fluctuations while concurrently facilitating the charging of the converters' DC link directly from the grid.},

The proposed explicit controllers consist in precomputed (optimal) state feedbacks that are selected according to the measured state using binary search-trees. This type of controller is well suited to obtain very fast control algorithms that impose high dynamic performance. The control scheme is based on two cascaded explicit model predictive controllers, one for the torque control another for the speed control. The nonlinearities of the motor dynamics that are due to the speed are taken into account into the torque controller derivation. The resulting adaptive closed-loop system presents a high dynamic performance for all operating points. A rotor speed and position observer is used to orient the control variables on the rotor flux without position sensor. The overall control scheme allows optimal use of the inverter and drive dynamic capabilities. The proposed concepts are validated experimentally.},

One natureinspired intelligence method, the Particle Swarm Optimization, is used for the vibration control of the beam. Three different variants of the Particle Swarm Optimization were tested, namely, the simple Particle Swarm Optimization, the inertia Particle Swarm Optimization and the Constriction Particle Swarm Optimization. A linear feedback control law and a quadratic cost function are used, so that the results are comparable with the classical linear quadratic regulator approach. The same problem has been solved with two other stochastic based optimization algorithms, namely a Genetic Algorithm and a Differential Evolution and the results are used for comparison. The numerical simulation shows that sufficient vibration suppression can be achieved by means of this method.},

Coordinating distributed generators (DGs) is complex, so communication-based controllers are proliferating in the literature. Then, this work proposes a distributed control strategy for islanded ac/dc multi-MGs interconnected by interlinking converters (ILCs). The proposed scheme is implemented in the ILCs and consists of distributed controllers that equalize global generation costs, allowing secondary control in each MG. Control actions that safeguard the saturated operation of MGs and ILCs are included in the control designs. The simultaneous operation with multiple objectives is possible due to adjusting control parameters according to a prioritization criterion. Experiments are conducted through an extensive simulated environment. The results show the proposed multiobjective controllers could maintain global optimal costs during normal operation while not overloading DGs, ILCs, subgrids, and clusters of ILCs. Furthermore, the strategy may reduce operational costs in the long term by protecting the lifetime of critical MG components. Desynchronization of incremental costs is enforced at 15\% at most under demanding conditions. Also, it is possible to operate against considerable ({$>$}250 [ms]) time delays in the tests.},

This competitive paradigm penalizes the loss relative to the optimal control actions chosen by a clairvoyant policy, and allows tracking the optimal performance in hindsight no matter how disturbances are generated. In this article, we propose the first receding horizon scheme based on the repeated computation of finite horizon regret-optimal policies, and we establish stability and safety guarantees for the resulting closed-loop system. Our derivations combine novel monotonicity properties of clairvoyant policies with suitable terminal ingredients. We prove that our scheme is recursively feasible, stabilizing, and that it achieves bounded regret relative to the infinite horizon clairvoyant policy. Last, we show that the policy optimization problem can be solved efficiently through convex--concave programming. Our numerical experiments show that minimizing regret can outperform standard receding horizon approaches when the disturbances poorly fit classical design assumptions---even when the finite horizon planning is recomputed less frequently.},

This feature makes the converter suitable for applications with a wide input voltage range. The range of the dc gain is increased by the implementation of the combined energy transfer principle. A reconfigurable structure is used to combine the energy transfer by the isolation transformer and the coupled inductor of the impedance-source network. The adaptive mode change activates the energy transfer via an additional winding in the qZS network at lower voltages, which results in considerable efficiency improvement. Consequently, the input voltage range of the converter is extended to the values useful in photovoltaic applications impacted by partial shading. The proposed approach is verified in a photovoltaic (PV) microconverter, where the energy harvest from a PV module is possible during shading by enabling the global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT). It is demonstrated that the dual-mode operation of the converter helps to achieve a flat efficiency curve along with outstanding maximum power point tracking (MPPT) performance.},

How the particles move through the problem space is therefore critical to the success of the algorithm. This study utilises meta optimisation to compare a number of velocity update equations to determine which features of each are of benefit to the algorithm. A number of hybrid velocity update equations are proposed based on other high performing velocity update equations. This research also presents a novel application of PSO to train a neural network function approximator to address the watershed management problem. It is found that the standard PSO with a linearly changing inertia, the proposed hybrid Attractive Repulsive PSO with avoidance of worst locations (AR PSOAWL) and Adaptive Velocity PSO (AV PSO) provide the best performance overall. The results presented in this paper also reveal that commonly used PSO parameters do not provide the best performance. Increasing and negative inertia values were found to perform better.},

  abstract = {A digital control technique for the inverter stage of uninterruptible power supplies is proposed, which is based on a predictive regulator on both output voltage and inductor current. Its aim is to achieve a deadbeat dynamic response for the controlled variables (output voltage and inverter current). Besides the linear state feedback which allocates system poles at the origin so as to achieve deadbeat response for all state variables, the use of a disturbance observer for the estimation of the load current and of any other source of errors (such as dead-times, parameter, and model mismatches) is investigated. The proposed solution is able to guarantee a fast dynamic response and also a precise compensation of any source of unpredictable disturbance. Moreover, with a proper design of observer parameters, it is possible to reduce control sensitivity to model uncertainties, parameter mismatches, and noise on sensed variables, which usually characterizes existing deadbeat control techniques. Finally, the control algorithm is quite simple and requires only the measurements of the output voltage and inductor current. Experimental results on a single-phase 2 kVA prototype show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Proportional-resonant controllers are largely used for grid-connected converters with LCL filters to ensure sinusoidal reference tracking and harmonic disturbance rejection. However, the design of such controllers becomes more difficult when it is necessary to ensure stability and suitable performance for converters operating under uncertain grid conditions, from stiff to weaker, and also when the number of resonants increases. In this more challenging scenario, available design procedures may lead to a poor tradeoff between transient and steady-state performances. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an off-line automated control design procedure to obtain multiple robust optimized proportional-resonant controllers. The proposed procedure consists of two steps, where a particle swarm algorithm is used to obtain: i) the gains of an inner loop ensuring optimal active damping for the LCL filter resonance; ii) the gains of multiple proportional-resonant controllers by minimizing a tracking error index, taking into account uncertain grid impedance and control signal limits. The robust stability of the closed-loop system with the control gains tuned by the metaheuristics is certificated through a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function, constructed based on linear matrix inequalities. Several results from control Hardware-in-the-loop are presented for a case study, revealing that the proposal provides better performance in terms of reference tracking and disturbance rejection, when compared to similar control strategies from the literature. Experimental results from a prototype connected to the utility grid attest the practical feasibility of the proposed procedure.},

Furthermore the simple dual integrator based architecture of a SOGI filter facilitates frequency adaptation, for example as is used in motor drive applications. However a consequence of this simple architecture is that the digital form of the SOGI filter is highly susceptible to discretization errors which can compromise the converter steady state tracking accuracy. This paper now presents an alternative state-space approach to realise accurate discrete SOGI filters using Hold and Tustin (pre-warp) methods. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been verified using simulation and experimental investigations of an inverter interfaced to a distorted grid and controlled using multiple harmonic SOGI filters.},

This work comprehensively analyses a model-free control algorithm for three-phase inverters using DRL agents. To this end, different deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agents with variable hyperparameters were conceptualized, designed, and tested. On average, DDPG agents were shown to have excellent performance in the control of power inverters. Indeed, DDPG agents reduce the impact of model uncertainties and non-linear dynamics. To validate the proposed control policy, the two-level voltage source power inverter is simulated. Also, the main features of the control strategy are analyzed in terms of computational cost, root medium square error (RMSE), and total harmonic distortion (THD). Simulated results reveal that the proposed control strategy exhibits strong performance in the current control task, achieving a maximum RMSE of 0.78 A and a THD of 3.17\% for a 6 kHz sampling frequency.},

Correspondingly, a decoupling coordinated control strategy for the SCL and a bidirectional AC--DC interlinking converter (BIC) is proposed based on a small signal model of the entire system and the principle of voltage regulation. The interferences between the SCL and the BIC due to the coupling of control factors are eliminated by the series and parallel decoupling methods that adopt additional current closed-loop control and output voltage feedforward control, respectively. The proposed HMG topology and strategy can ensure the realization of the predesigned functions of dual converters and avoid frequent switching between the grid-tied mode and the island mode, which improves the fault ride-through capability and power quality.

However, the complex structure and control dynamics of hybrid AC and DC MGs challenge their operational stability, especially when compared to individual AC or DC MGs. This paper develops a holistic small-signal model of autonomous hybrid AC and DC MGs, which incorporates AC and DC sections as well as interface converters between AC and DC buses. The small-signal stability of the developed model is analyzed to derive a stability region. In particular, a 2-D stability region is defined using flexible cross-domain parameter combinations from either control systems or main power circuits of hybrid AC and DC systems. Further, an artificial intelligence (AI)-aided support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is employed to estimate the stability region boundary (SRB), which provides a computationally efficient way to visualize the stable operation region. Leveraging the real-time hardware-in-the-loop (RT-HIL) platform, case studies conducted on a test hybrid system with five converters (two DC-AC inverters, two DC-DC converters, and one interlink converter) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed work. Multi-fold cross-validation of all the case studies confirms that the out-of-sample misclassification rate meets the required threshold of 5\%.},

For such a converter system, the gravimetric power density is a key metric. Therefore, this paper systematically investigates the weight limits of several converter topology concepts: Starting from a standard two-level four-switch non-inverting buck-boost converter benchmark system, fully soft-switched operation, as well as flying-capacitor multilevel and partial-power-processing variants are compared by means of a comprehensive Pareto optimization (mission-profile efficiency vs. gravimetric power density).

  abstract = {The article proposes a ground-breaking solution to address the challenge of imposing constraints in a full state feedback (FSF) control system. Its simplicity is comparable to the introduction of saturation blocks in the cascaded control system. In the developed control system, a given state variable is stabilized at the threshold value using a separate FSF controller. The overall controller consists then of a set of controllers, the main one with an external reference signal and auxiliary controllers with the internal references set to the desired limits to be imposed on each of the physical states of the investigated plant, operating in parallel fashion (hence the proposed name-multithreaded). This means that in each time instance, the processor executes all FSF controllers. Additionally, if the auxiliary integral states are implemented, a back-calculation algorithm is employed to keep the auxiliary states at the desired level for the controllers that are idling at a given time instance. The median of the calculated control signals is put through to the plant as a control signal. Such an elegant and straightforward way of handling constraints in the state feedback system has never been reported before and is currently patent pending. The proposed method is validated for a servo drive using hardware-in-the-loop setup. All the obtained results confirm technical feasibility of the controller structure and its ability to keep all the state variables within the required intervals.},

A multithreaded state controller is proposed in the form of three state controllers: one to control grid currents and dc-link voltage if limits of the currents are not reached, and two state controllers that are put into the closed loop if one of the current limits is reached. A complete design procedure is proposed, including the selection of all gains present in the three state-feedback controllers using the pole placement method. An algorithm of soft switching between the three control signals is also developed. Sharing the desired dynamics between the threads is fulfilled thanks to the eigenstructure assignment introduced to overcome the problem of multiple solutions by choosing the most orthogonal eigenvectors. The proposed control system is then verified in a simulation, and its high practicality is demonstrated experimentally.},

  abstract = {Battery emulators provide a method for examining various aspects of control algorithms and power interfacing converters used in applications such as AC/DC micro-grids, electric vehicle power train, battery cell balancing circuit and control, battery storage energy management system design, etc. Many of these applications can not afford the down time caused by recharging of batteries hence the testers usually keep an additional set of charged batteries, increasing the cost further. Due to non-linearities within battery chemistries and due to charge/discharge effects, two sets of batteries can no longer be considered identical. Additionally, actual batteries have extremely strict safety requirements that have to be fulfilled. To alleviate some of these issues, a battery emulator has been proposed in this paper to replicate the electrical characteristics of a battery. The emulator is designed using a partial power processing (input-parallel, output-series) approach such that high efficiency and low control effort is achieved by utilizing a dual-active bridge (DAB) cell which is sized to less than 40\% of overall power needed.},

Here, the parameters of FOPID controller are tuned by PSO-GWO technique to mitigate the harmonics. Comparing Passive with Active Filters, the former is tested to be bulky and design is complex and the later is not cost effective for high rating. Hence, a hybrid structure of shunt active and passive filter is designed using MATLAB/Simulink and in real time experimental set up. The compensation process for shunt active filter is different from predictable methods such as (p-q) or ( i\_d-i\_q ) theory, in which only the source current is to be sensed. The performance of the proposed controller is tested under different operating conditions such as steady and transient states and indices like Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), Input Power Factor (IPF), Real Power (P) and Reactive Power (Q) are estimated and compared with that of other controllers. The parameters of FOPIDC and Conventional PID Controller (CPIDC) are optimized by the techniques such as PSO, GWO and hybrid PSO-GWO.

  abstract = {The dynamics and performance of low-inertia ac grids with frequency support (e.g., droop and virtual inertia controls) have been investigated thoroughly. Recently, the dc grid concept has been considered a cost-effective and efficient option in modern power distribution systems, where one of its most valuable applications is to support the frequency and voltage of low-inertia and weak grids. However, the literature does not fully address a comprehensive stability analysis and performance assessment of a low-inertia system supported by a dc grid. Therefore, this paper presents a thorough yet straightforward dc-side impedance-based stability analysis of a low-inertia ac grid connected to a dc grid via a bidirectional voltage-source converter (VSC) equipped with a virtual inertia controller to improve the ac grid frequency behavior. In the proposed virtual inertia control, low-pass and high-pass filter implementations are investigated, and their performance is compared. The dc-side equivalent impedance models are developed for the 1) interlinking VSC combined with its ac grid, considering virtual inertia control and typical ac grid components: synchronous generators (with their turbine, governer, and exciter models), induction motor loads, and static loads, and 2) dc grid considering its practical components: distributed generators, constant-power loads, and resistive loads. Therefore, unlike previous methods, the proposed impedance modeling and stability analysis approach considers the impacts of the ac grid frequency/voltage dynamics and dc grid dynamics on the VSC dc-bus stability. Impedance interactions are characterized and used to assess the overall system dynamics and stability and the impacts of the system and control parameters. The analytical results are validated by detailed offline and real-time simulation studies.},

  abstract = {Modern microgrids are systems comprising both Alternative Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) subgrids, integrated with Distributed Generations (DGs), storage systems, and Electric Vehicles (EVs) parking facilities. Achieving stable and reliable load flow control amidst varying load, generation, and charging/discharging strategies requires a hierarchical control scheme. This paper proposes an hourly power flow (PF) analysis within an Energy Management System (EMS) for AC/DC Hybrid Microgrids interconnected via an Interlinking Converter (IC) in both grid-connected and islanded modes. The framework operates within a two-level hierarchically controlled platform. Tertiary control at the top level optimizes DGs' reference power for generation and consumption, minimizing power purchase costs and load shedding in grid-connected and islanded modes, respectively. DG converters employ current control mode to share their power references as the primary controller. While no secondary controller is adopted in this scheme, the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in islanded mode utilizes P/Q droop control to maintain voltage and frequency in the AC subsystem. Power sharing between AC and DC subgrids through IC is determined by the difference between AC grid frequency and DC link voltage. Integration of controlled converters' buses into PF equations enables solving the unified system using the traditional Newton-Raphson (NR) method. A segment of a real distribution grid planned for installation in Italy under the HYPERRIDE project serves as a case study. Comparison with MATLAB/Simulink results confirms the effectiveness, precision, and convergence speed of the proposed model and control schemes, demonstrating efficient load distribution and voltage/frequency restoration in islanded mode.},

Power networks are undergoing a transition from the traditional model of centralised generation towards a smart decentralised network of renewable sources and ES systems, organised into autonomous microgrids. ES systems can provide a range of services, particularly when distributed throughout the power network. The introduction of distributed ES represents a fundamental change for power networks, increasing the network control problem dimensionality and adding long time-scale dynamics associated with the storage systems' state of charge levels. Managing microgrids with many small distributed ES systems requires new scalable control strategies that are robust to power network and communication network disturbances. This paper reviews the range of services distributed ES systems can provide, and the control challenges they introduce. The focus of this paper is a presentation of the latest decentralised, centralised and distributed multi-agent control strategies designed to coordinate distributed microgrid ES systems. Finally, multi-agent control with agents satisfying Wooldridge's definition of intelligence is proposed as a promising direction for future research.},

  abstract = {In conventional photovoltaic (PV)-battery systems, a centralized battery storage system (BSS) is typically connected through a separate bidirectional converter at the common dc link to support the PV system. It is known that a bidirectional converter typically requires more switches than a unidirectional converter, and hence, a complete PV-battery power interface will result in a high-cost system and will suffer high power losses. This paper proposed an integrated battery storage interface with soft-switching capability for module-integrated PV systems. In the proposed system, a multi-input converter (MIC) structure that consists of an integrated soft-switched quasi-resonant (QR) Cuk- and flyback-based circuit is presented. In this approach, the battery charging circuit is integrated with the input side of the PV power optimizer while the battery discharging circuit of the proposed system shares the output filter of the PV power optimizer, resulting in a compact and efficient system. The proposed converter is capable of tracking the maximum power point (MPP) and following the charging profile (constant voltage and constant current) of the battery. Moreover, all the switches in the proposed converter are able to achieve soft-switched turn on and turn off for different operating conditions. The operating principles and the theoretical analysis of the proposed system are presented. Experimental results on a 175-W proof-of-concept prototype are presented to demonstrate the features of the proposed converter.},

So, MF-PC remarkably has a better performance against uncertainties and disturbance than the traditional model predictive control (MPC). Except for the predicting system, MF-PC and MPC utilize the same predictive algorithm in power electronics applications. This paper introduces an alternative predictive algorithm, which dramatically simplifies the implementation of MF-PC compared to MPC. The proposed predictive algorithm utilizes the ABC coordinates instead of the common stationary or rotary frames. The frame transformation is employed to avoid complicated and coupled equations of the ABC coordinates. However, the model-free control does not face this complexity issue to need a frame transformation. This paper presents a general MF-PC strategy in the ABC frame for multiphase converters and electrical drives. This method performs the predictive algorithm independently for each phase of the converter or electrical motor. Therefore, the switching of the multiphase converters, which was extremely complicated in the standard predictive algorithm, can be easily applied. Consequently, the computational burden is decreased significantly. Moreover, this predictive technique does not require a weighting factor. The proposed ABC frame MF-PC is validated by a five-phase induction motor simulation. The experimental verification is made by a three-phase induction motor.},

The MFPCC has a general prediction algorithm that can be implemented in any reference frame. Using this feature, and the fact that each winding of the OW-SynRM is supplied separately by two legs of the dual inverter, the current predictions are achieved independently for each phase in the Cartesian coordinates. Then, three parallel cost functions are defined for three predicted phase currents. Thus, the finite control-set approach is utilized separately for each phase to determine the switching state of the dual inverter. In addition, an adaptive proportional-resonant extended state observer (PR-ESO) is introduced to improve the current predictions regarding the operating frequency of the motor. The proposed MFPCC for OW-SynRM has several advantages. First, the computational burden is decreased significantly because the prediction algorithm utilizes fewer candidates in the Cartesian coordinates. In addition, the weighting factor is not required due to using independent cost functions. Furthermore, the zero sequence current is automatically adjusted without a controller. Finally, the PR-ESO-based model-free approach improves the current predictions of the proposed method. The proposed MFPCC of the OW-SynRM is evaluated using the experimental results.},

The proposed method is performed in a cascaded finite set predictive control approach to decrease the computational burden. In the proposed method, a state observer estimates the ZSC and its disturbances. The estimated ZSC is suppressed by a disturbance rejecting control loop that produces the reference of common-mode voltage (CMV). As a benefit, the motor parameters have not appeared in this process, which improves the robustness of the whole control system. To reduce the computational burden, the model-free predictive control (MFPC) is implemented in two cascaded stages. First, the predictive algorithm is performed for the voltage vectors (VVs) with zero CMV to detect the optimum zone of the space vector locations. In the second stage, the proposed MFPC is implemented with the VVs of the selected zone, and the optimum VV is achieved. In this way, the predictive algorithm is iterated 13 times. On the contrary, the conventional predictive algorithm is iterated 27 times for the VVs of the dual inverter. So, the calculation of the proposed method is reduced almost 50\%. This feature is achieved without neglecting any of the VVs. Therefore, the performance of the proposed method is not degraded by reducing the calculations. A comparative analysis is carried out through simulations and experimental tests. The results confirm that while the proposed MFPC method is computationally efficient, its performance and robustness are also improved.},

Replacing the conventional model of the system with an ultralocal model can effectively improve the robustness of the model predictive control (MPC) because all types of uncertainties that correlate with the system modeling are removed in the ultralocal model. This article proposes an integral sliding mode observer (ISMO)-based ultralocal model for the finite-set model predictive current control (FS-MPCC) of an induction motor (IM). The ISMO is constructed based on the Lyapunov theory to guarantee the stability of the proposed control method. Moreover, an analytical comparison is made between the proposed ISMO and the conventional extended state observer (ESO) in the application of the ultralocal model. This comparison shows that the stability of ESO depends on the unknown term of the ultralocal model. In contrast, the stability of the proposed ISMO does not rely on any terms of the ultralocal model. Experimental tests confirm that the proposed FS-MPCC method is practically applicable to the IM drive system. Also, it improves the robustness of the predictive method against model uncertainty.},

A comparative analysis is conducted through simulations among four different speed control methods, including the proposed method and the first-order model-free speed control for the non-cascaded control scheme, as well as the Proportional-Integral (PI) controller and model-free controller for the cascaded speed control scheme. According to the results, the proposed method achieves a faster dynamic response compared to the rest of the control approaches.},

  abstract = {Traditional methods of determining steady-state power system operating points are not applicable to droop-controlled microgrids. The conditions of an islanded microgrid, including the absence of a slack bus and inherent coupling of complex power, frequency, and bus voltage, require new tools to properly analyze. In this study, a method of determining the operating points of droop-controlled microgrids is proposed. The procedure is similar in form and function to a traditional power flow analysis, but is performed in the synchronous reference frame to ensure compatibility with conventional inverter models. A quasi-Newton iterative process is used to solve the nonlinear equations pertaining to each generation unit and load bus. The method provides a structured approach to determining the consistent system-level linearization points required for large-scale microgrid studies. Grid-forming, grid-feeding, and grid-supporting generation units are supported, along with both constant impedance and constant power loads. The method is validated in hardware experiments, simulations, and comparisons to results of existing power flow algorithms. As an example of the method's potential applications, a procedure for determining droop constants that ensure equal Q sharing between generation units is constructed around the proposed method's basic functionality.},

Because of its benefits in terms of efficiency, component rating and power density, partial power converter (PPC) is a very attractive solution to operate as power optimizers. In this paper, a new reconfigurable Full-bridge-based PPC is proposed. The reconfigurable scheme allows to take advantage of both step-up PPC of Type I, and step-down PPC of Type II. In order to enlarge the operation range, the proposed converter can also be reconfigured as a classical full-power converter.

  abstract = {The defossilization of industrial processes is currently one of the main efforts at stopping the climate crisis. In particular, the beer industry has been looking at electrifying its heat-dependent processes to reduce its carbon footprint. Yet, current solutions are typically tailored for large-scale breweries leaving microbreweries, due to a larger relative cost, to use gas as primary resource, which makes it difficult to control the process temperature. To ensure a fine temperature control, thus avoid malt's stress, a dc-powered heating element can be used. Yet, the cost of this solution is still not suitable for microbreweries. In this paper, we propose the use of a reconfigurable partial-power converter that allows to increase the overall power rating while maximizing its efficiency, together with a full-bridge rectifier that controls the dc-link voltage and ensures low harmonic-content. The simulation results show that the control scheme is capable of reconfiguring the partial-power converter to seamlessly transition between a flyback mode to a step-down partial-power converter mode only when full heating power is needed, thus allowing to shrink the cost of the overall system.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a control strategy for integrated dc microgrids (MGs) into power systems. In this method, the DC MGs are capable of importing or exporting energy from or to the AC grid based on the loading conditions. The DC MGs employ an interlinking converter (IC) as a bidirectional back-to-back converter for a distributed generator (DG) unit at the point of common coupling (PCC). In a multi-DG unit DC MG, an energy management strategy should be planned by sharing network loads among dispatchable DG units, and meanwhile, the dc network voltage should be regulated. The proposed control system utilizes an ac voltage superimposed on the nominal dc voltage of the network. The frequency of the superimposed ac voltage is used to modify the conventional droop control, which leads to simultaneous accurate load sharing and regulated voltage in a decentralized manner. The IC DG unit equipped with the proposed controller interfaces the dc network through a dc/dc buck converter and the ac grid through an active rectifier. This strategy provides a seamless transition between islanded and grid-connected modes for the DC MGs. The performance of the proposed control system is evaluated through simulations studies via PLECS and a set of experimental results.},

  abstract = {Hybrid microgrids (HMGs) are more flexible and require fewer power converters than ac and dc microgrids (MGs); however, the number of wires/buses in HMGs is still considerable, especially when there are multiple voltage levels in the dc subgrid. There are five wires/buses in conventional singlephase ac/bipolar dc (BDC) HMGs, two (phase and neutral) in the ac subgrid, and three (positive, zero, and negative) in the BDC subgrid. This article presents a new four-wire architecture with a common zero and neutral bus for a single-phase ac/BDC HMG that features a new bidirectional interlinking converter (IC). Using the proposed structure, the number of wires/buses and total costs are reduced without increasing the number of IC switches or complicating its control method. Besides, the common zero and neutral bus in the proposed structure provides proper grounding for both subgrids, reduces leakage current ({$\approx$}0 mA), and improves fault tolerability in dc fault conditions. For this purpose, the dc-side fault ride-through (FRT) capabilities of the conventional and proposed ICs are compared by driving their mathematical models under dc fault conditions. The most severe currents experienced by conventional IC switches in a resistive grounded system are 760 A under positive and 1300 A under negative and zero terminal-to-ground (ZG) fault conditions. However, the proposed IC does not experience any overcurrent in ZG fault conditions, and its switches' current stresses are reduced to 170 A for positive and 320 A for negative terminalto-ground fault conditions. To validate the performance of the proposed IC and its modulation technique, simulation results in PSCAD/EMTDC environment and experimental results based on a scaled-down prototype are presented.},

  abstract = {A hybrid microgrid (MG) combines both AC and DC MGs using a bidirectional interlinking converter (IC). In a hybrid MG, grounding both the AC and DC MGs is done using isolated converters or low-frequency transformers. However, low-frequency transformers complicate the converter design, and high-frequency transformers reduce efficiency. Consequently, non-isolated ICs are often preferred in hybrid MGs. The grounding of non-isolated hybrid MGs is a complex issue that requires ongoing research and attention. Comprehensive knowledge of the available AC and DC MG grounding strategies and their effects is essential for designing, operating, and protecting the hybrid MGs. This paper develops a holistic grounding strategy for hybrid MGs, which incorporates AC and DC sections as well as ICs between AC and DC buses. Line-to-ground (LG) fault detection and protection, service continuity, common mode voltage, leakage current levels, system reliability, transient LG fault current magnitude, personnel/equipment safety, and insulation requirements are thoroughly examined by comparing different grounding strategies.},

  abstract = {A hybrid microgrid is an interconnected system of an AC and DC subgrid using an interlinking converter (IC). The main concerns for the stable operation of a hybrid microgrid are primarily related to the control of the DG, ICs, and loads. The small perturbation instability associated with the stability of the control loops affects the performance of the IC. The linearized model of the IC has the cross-coupling of axes d and q that adds to the effective impedance at the output side of the filter section. This needs to be addressed, as it affects the power-sharing capability of the IC. In this work, structural decoupling is directly derived from the linearized state-space model. It ensures a mathematically rigorous decoupling strategy that is precisely aligned with the system's dynamics, ensuring a more accurate and effective control framework and offering a more scalable framework for decoupling. Unlike conventional d-q decoupling strategies, which rely on empirical separation of the control loops in a rotating frame, this decoupling approach based on the linearized state-space model of the interlinking converter is less complex and a perfect decoupled is obtained. MATLAB simulation results and the experimental results are also verified.},

Interlinking AC/DC converter is the key of this topology which has the following characteristics: being able to provide two equal pole voltages in DC side; complying with the standards of current quality at AC side; being able to control active and reactive power independently in AC side, and transmitting bidirectional power. In this paper, two categories of power converters including single-stage and two-stage converters are proposed for this topology. A new cost-effective control strategy is added to the control of general grid-connected converter for each interlinking converter, and the control of autonomous DC-link pole voltage for both candidates is achieved. Detailed simulations based on the designed control strategies are conducted to validate the function of control strategies under the operation conditions of different DC sides. The performances of two selected interlinking converters with balanced and unbalanced DC loads are analyzed. Suggested power quality of microgrid and total harmonic distortion (THD) analysis are demonstrated in grid-tied and islanded modes. Eventually, semiconductor power loss simulations based on a closed-loop thermal network simulation are conducted. Thereby, the mutual effects of power loss and initial junction temperature are investigated.},

This paper proposes a set of distributed model predictive control schemes for the secondary control level to control certain variables to specific values and other variables within secure pre-defined bands into H-MGs. Specifically, optimal dispatch of active and reactive power is achieved while frequency and voltages are regulated within secure bands in H-MGs.

In this architecture, crucial requirements for the string-level converters (SLCs) include the capability to generate positive and negative output voltages and to provide isolation. To fulfill these requirements, a dual active bridge converter connected to a bridgeless converter as the PDPP SLCs is considered. In this architecture, while SLCs ensure maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for each PV string using conventional MPPT algorithms, the central converter controls the virtual bus voltage. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed PV to virtual bus PDPP architecture with a system efficiency ranging from 96.4\% to 99\%.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new approach to regulate the output voltage of a resonant, constant voltage transfer ratio 380 V/48 V isolated dc-dc converter is presented. Rather than applying variable frequency control to the resonant converter, which would result in reactive power processing and a more complicated electromagnetic compatibility filter design, the converter remains in its optimal operating point all time and an additional partial-power (PP) processing auxiliary converter is used to tightly regulate the output voltage. The PP converter, supplied through a tertiary winding of the resonant converter's transformer, regulates the output by adding or subtracting voltage from the dc input and has only a marginal impact on the overall efficiency of the dc-dc converter. The principal of operation is explained in detail including Sankey diagrams to illustrate the power processing of the converter and a feedback control system is proposed to tightly regulate the 48 V output voltage. A hardware demonstrator rated at 1.5 kW is implemented to cope with input voltage variations between 340 and 420 V and experimental results are provided showing that the output voltage can be kept within \textpm 1\% of the nominal 48 V even under harsh input voltage and load transients. The realized dc-dc converter with PP pre-regulation features an overall efficiency of 97.7\% at rated power and a power density of 8.6 kWdm-3 (141w/3 in).},

They can interconnect and operate on different frequency qualities to enhance the penetration of renewable energy resources. To operate multiple MGs on different frequency qualities, a framework of the stand-alone multimicrogrid (MMG) system is proposed in this study. In the proposed MMG system, each MG connects to the common dc line through an ac/dc interlinking converter. A droop frequency control is proposed for the interlinking converter to improve frequency control performance and achieve autonomous power sharing. The sensitivity analysis with respect to the proposed control is performed to evaluate the stability of the converter system. The proposed droop frequency controller is evaluated in the MMG system with three MGs. The feasibility of the proposed controller is verified by the hardware-in-the-loop simulation using OPAL-RT technologies. The droop frequency controller is executed in digital signal processor TMS-320F-28335 while the proposed MMG system is modeled in a real-time simulator (OP5600). A comparison study on the proposed droop frequency control and conventional P/f control is presented. By using the proposed frequency control, the energy reserves in the adjacent microgrids can be shared effectively to achieve better performance of frequency regulation in the stand-alone MMG system.},

  abstract = {This study proposes an advanced control scheme for the interlinking inverters of the hybrid AC/DC microgrids, which facilitates a seamless transition between grid-connected and stand-alone/islanding modes for the microgrid. Due to a nonlinear relationship between the terminal voltages of the voltage-source inverter (VSI) interfacing through inductor--capacitor (LC) filters with the grid voltages and currents, a feedback linearization technique (FLT) is employed to control the interlinking VSI under both grid-connected and islanding operations. The FLT-based current controllers are applied in the grid-connected mode, in which they adjust the power exchange between the DC and AC subgrids and mitigate the distortion of the grid currents produced by nonlinear loads. Under the stand-alone operation, the AC bus voltages are directly regulated by the FLT-voltage controllers of the interlinking VSI. In order to reduce the inrush currents and voltage overshot at the instant of mode switching, the FLT-based controllers are performed all the time regardless of the operating modes, where the voltage references for the VSI are not changed abruptly. The control performance of the VSI is highly satisfactory with low-transient overshoot values of the voltages and currents and low total harmonic distortion (THD) values of the grid currents and AC bus voltages are about 3.5\% and 2.7\%, respectively, under the nonlinear load condition. The validity of the new control strategy is verified by the simulation work, which investigates the operation of a hybrid AC/DC microgrid.},

A controller based on reinforcement learning was developed and evaluated in comparison to traditional proportional-integral controllers in dynamic and faultprone environments. The results illustrate the superior adaptability, stability, and optimization potential of the reinforcement learning approach, particularly in addressing dynamic disturbances and ensuring robust performance. The study illustrates how reinforcement learning can facilitate the transition from conceptual design to implementation by automating optimization processes, enabling interface automation, and enhancing system-level testing. Based on the aforementioned findings, this paper presents future directions for research, which include the integration of domain-specific knowledge into the reinforcement learning process and the validation of this process in realworld environments.

However, due to the mismatched uncertainty in the mathematical model of the ASS, sliding mode control (SMC) cannot be applied directly to control the system. Thus, the purpose of this work is to adapt the SMC technique for the control of ASS, where particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to design the sliding surface such that the effect of the mismatched uncertainty can be minimized. The performance of the proposed sliding mode controller based on the PSO algorithm is compared with the linear quadratic optimal control (LQR) and the existing passive suspension system. In comparison with the other control methods, the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed controller, where it significantly improved the ride comfort 67\% and 25\% more than the passive suspension system and the LQR controller, respectively.\^A},

  abstract = {Classical power systems, which are typically structured in top-down topologies, are gradually evolving towards more decentralized systems comprised by clusters of smart subgrids to cope with the increasing penetration of distributed generation, energy storage systems and controllable loads. These clusters will increase the overall reliability, optimize resource usage and reduce investments in back-up systems. However, tying subgrids via passive devices (tie lines or power transformers) poses certain problems from the point of view of modularity and controllability. They also limit the connection capability of subgrids, as it is expected that systems with different voltage natures (ac and dc) will coexist in the future network. In this context, interlinking converters (IC) have emerged as a universal approach for the interconnection of such subgrids regardless of their characteristics. These power converters not only provide power flow control, but they also improve the power quality of networks through different ancillary services. Therefore, ICs are expected to be the energy routers of the future, smartly connecting and managing the interaction among grids. In the literature several topologies and control techniques have been proposed for this type of converters to transfer power between grids and provide support under contingencies. However, there are no classifications from the point of view of the participation of ICs in the primary regulation of the power system. The aim of this paper is to 1) identify the main characteristics of ICs compared to conventional interconnections based on passive devices, 2) review the most usual IC topologies depending on the nature of the grids they are interconnecting (ac-ac, ac-dc or dc-dc) and 3) analyse and compare the different control approaches for the primary regulation via ICs and propose a general classification based on this analysis regardless of the number of conversion power stages of the IC and the nature and characteristics of tied grids.},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic energy is a wide kind of green energy. A high performance on these systems is needed to make the most of energy produced by solar cells. Also, there must be a constant adaptation due to the continuous variation of power production. Control techniques for Power Converters like the MPPT algorithm (Maximum Power Point Tracking) present very good results on photovoltaic chains. Nevertheless, losses on power elements reduce global performance and the voltage/current adaptation is not always possible. In this paper, the use of the high efficiency structure Four Switch Buck-Boost for Photovoltaic systems is addressed. FSBB Converters present some advantages regarding other Power Converter structures: it has few electrical components, output voltage can be higher or lower than input voltage, and it presents a non-inverted output voltage as happens with others Buck-Boost Converters. A prototype of FSBB has been developed in order to exploit these new capabilities for a Photovoltaic DC-DC power application (solar module: 0V to 20V input voltage and different resistive loads). The implemented MPPT digital control chooses between a Buck or Boost mode, depending on the working conditions. Firstly, an introduction and the FSBB operating mode are addressed. Then, the adaptive MPPT control algorithm is detailed. And finally, the experimental results and conclusion are presented.},

  abstract = {The trend toward high power density, high operating frequency, and low profile in power converters has exposed a number of limitations in the use of conventional wire-wound magnetic component structures. A planar magnetic is a low-profile transformer or inductor utilizing planar windings, instead of the traditional windings made of Cu wires. In this paper, the most important factors for planar transformer (PT) design including winding loss, core loss, leakage inductance, and stray capacitance have individually been investigated. The tradeoffs among these factors have to be analyzed in order to achieve optimal parameters. Combined with an application, four typical winding arrangements have been compared to illustrate their advantages and disadvantages. An improved interleaving structure with optimal behaviors is proposed, which constructs the top layer paralleling with the bottom layer and then in series with the other turns of the primary, so that a lower magnetomotive force ratio m can be obtained, as well as minimized ac resistance, leakage inductance, and even stray capacitance. A 1.2-kW full-bridge dc--dc converter prototype employing the improved PT structure has been constructed, over 96\% efficiency is achieved, and a 2.7\% improvement, compared with the noninterleaving structure, is obtained.},

  abstract = {Electric grids are undergoing several changes, mostly driven by the replacement of classical highly-inertial generators by converter-interfaced generation and storage systems. This entails the reduction of inherent inertia levels and might lead to instability issues. In a future scenario formed by grids of different natures and characteristics, power electronic converters will play a key role on grid tying applications. These converters are known as interlinking converters (ICs), and they enable total control over the power flow between interconnected grids. Therefore, they are envisioned to take part not only tying hybrid ac/dc systems but also in ac/ac connections. This paper presents a novel control strategy for ICs named dual inertia-emulation (DIE), that improves the dynamic response of tied grids by emulating inertia at both sides of the converter, and which can be employed at any IC regardless of the interconnected grid type (ac or dc). The proposed control is tested by means of time-domain simulations of WSCC 9-bus and IEEE 14-bus benchmark systems. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed technique increases the equivalent inertial response of the interconnected grids, hence reducing frequency oscillations and the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), and improving the frequency nadir.},

The purpose of these additional disturbances is to lump the plant-model mismatch and/or unmodeled disturbances. Its effectiveness has been proven for particular square cases only. For systems with a number of measured variables (p) greater than the number of manipulated variables (m), it is clear that any controller can track without offset at most m controlled variables. One may think that m integrating disturbances are sufficient to guarantee offset-free control in the m controlled variables. We show this idea is incorrect and present general conditions that allow zero steady-state offset. In particular, a number of integrating disturbances equal to the number of measured variables are shown to be sufficient to guarantee zero offset in the controlled variables. These results apply to square and nonsquare, open-loop stable, integrating and unstable systems.},

While many active damping methods have been proposed to overcome this issue, the role that pulse width modulation transport delay plays in the effectiveness of these strategies is still not fully resolved. This paper presents a theoretical discrete time-analysis framework that identifies three distinct regions of LCL filter resonance, namely, a high resonant frequency region where active damping is not required, a critical resonant frequency where a controller cannot stabilize the system, and a low resonant frequency region where active damping is essential. Suitable controllers are then proposed for the two stable regions, with gain calculations that allow for the greatest system bandwidth and damping. Simulation and experimental results verify the presented analysis.},

Supplementary loops are used to reduce frequency and voltage deviations in the ac bus without communications. The supplementary loop for voltage regulation is based on the droop controller by reducing direct and quadrature output voltages according to the active and reactive power demand. A model in a synchronous reference frame that integrates power sharing and voltage-current dynamics is also proposed. In addition, a methodology to develop an islanded microgrid model in a synchronous reference frame is proposed. Robustness analysis demonstrates stability of the LQR-ORT controller under variations in the frequency and the LCL filter components. Experimental results demonstrate accuracy of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the LQR-ORT controller on improving transient response and robustness in islanded mode.},

Implementations issues of parallel computation are discussed in order to accelerate the time required for the operations. The implementation in an FPGA proved to be quite fast, with the observed worst case execution time of 11,54 \textmu s for the presented example. These results contribute to embed GPC applications in processes that are typically controlled by classical controllers because of their fast dynamics.},

This study takes the opposite approach and simplifies the PSO method. To compare the efficacy of the original PSO and the simplified variant here, an easy technique is presented for efficiently tuning their behavioural parameters. The technique works by employing an overlaid meta-optimizer, which is capable of simultaneously tuning parameters with regard to multiple optimization problems, whereas previous approaches to meta-optimization have tuned behavioural parameters to work well on just a single optimization problem. It is then found that not only the PSO method and its simplified variant have comparable performance for optimizing a number of Artificial Neural Network problems, but also the simplified variant appears to offer a small improvement in some cases.},

Finally, a state-feedback controller composed of an error integrator and multi-resonant terms, named SF-MR controller is employed, where the state-feedback controller gains are calculated using an increased model of the controlled system. Independent of the three current controllers implemented in the series converter, the parallel converter of the UPQC will always be controlled to operate using the SF-MR controller. Mathematical models, stability and sensitivity analyses are presented and discussed in detail.

Such a task becomes even more difficult when resonant terms are included in the design to ensure that harmonic disturbances in the grid voltage and/or the load current are rejected, thus avoiding distortions of controlled variables. This study employs a differential evolution metaheuristic-based methodology to design the state-feedback multivariable and multiresonant controller.

The tuning of the controllers is performed using differential evolution metaheuristic in conjunction with the well-known linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) approach. This optimization algorithm avoids the empirical trial-and-error method for adjusting the weighting values of Q and R matrices while minimizing the cost function based on a weighted sum of the total harmonic distortion of the controlled variables, control loop errors, and control signals saturation. Thus, an adequate approach to adjust LQR-SF-MR controllers is achieved, proving useful for controlling active power filters (APF) since non-sinusoidal control references are involved. Furthermore, the proposed tuning method is appropriate for controlling voltage source inverters (VSI) following sinusoidal references and feeding non-linear loads since the high rejection of harmonic disturbances is reached. The effectiveness of the proposed design methodology for controllers' tuning is tested in a current-controlled 3-phase 4-wire (3P4W) shunt-APF, grid-connected through both L and LCL filters, as well as in a voltage-controlled 3P4W VSI connected to non-linear loads with LC filters. The control performances of the systems are extensively evaluated through experimental results.},

The primary control computes the voltage synthesized by the interfacing voltage-sourced converter such that the DER unit contributes active and reactive powers in support of the microgrid voltage amplitude and frequency. These operational requirements must be satisfied with respect to the converter safety and physical limitations, such as the limited magnitude of the converter output current and terminal voltage. In this paper, all the control requirements mentioned above are taken into account in a single constrained optimization problem using the framework of Model-based Predictive Control (MPC). Solving the primary control problem in this way allows the microgrid to respond to major disturbances such short-circuit faults and transitions between modes of operation, while the electronically-interfaced DER units operate within operational and safety limits.},

Ideally, this should be achieved by a decentralized primary control strategy that is independent of any communication infrastructure in order to increase the resilience of the microgrid. This is challenging as the primary control objectives in islanded and grid-connected modes of operation are conflicting. This paper proposes a decentralized control law for DER units based on state feedback and disturbance rejection. The controller provides an integral action which enables output current reference tracking. An ad-hoc partial input saturation technique is also proposed in order to prevent the integral action from having an adverse impact on the voltage amplitude and frequency regulation in the islanded mode of operation. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated via a time-domain simulation of a medium-voltage distribution network with three embedded DER units, as well as through an experimental three-bus microgrid with two DER units. The results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed control strategy to transitions between the modes of operation and other network topological changes.},

To that end, the interaction of each distributed energy resource unit within the microgrid is modeled as a lumped dynamic system, which results to be nonlinear and multivariable. For the closed-loop control of such multivariable systems, the full state feedback formulation is preferred which requires a suitable state observer. For the design of the observer and feedback gains, the solution of the linear-quadratic estimation and regulation problems is considered. For simplicity, an approximate linear model at a representative operating point is derived. The linear quadratic Gaussian/loop-transfer recovery is adopted as the design procedure to optimize the trajectory of the state variables subject to a desirable actuation effort, in this case of the voltage amplitude and frequency, yielding a solution that is robust to model uncertainties. The effectiveness of the strategy is assessed through time-domain simulation on the CIGRE benchmark medium-voltage distribution network with three distributed energy resource units. These results are compared to those obtained with conventional static droop gains and with a state-of-the-art technique from the literature.},

Among the existing multilevel converter topologies, the modular multilevel converter (MMC) provides the advantages of high modularity, availability, and high power quality. Moreover, the main advantage compared to cascaded multilevel converters is the lack of an input transformer which results in a reduction of cooling requirements, size, and cost. One of the drawbacks of this topology when used as an ac-ac converter is the input and output frequency components in the control loop, resulting in a more complex controller design. In this paper, a single-phase ac-ac MMC predictive control approach is proposed. The controller minimizes the input, output, and circulating current errors and balances the dc voltages. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed predictive control scheme.},

An LCL-filter is a third-order low-pass filter, which is commonly used with PWM rectifiers and inverters. When properly designed, an LCL-filter offers a much better suppression of the switching frequency current ripple than a simple inductor. However, there are many matters to consider when designing an LCL-filter. The wide control bandwidth of active power filters makes the design of an LCL-filter even more challenging.

However, due to the effect of line resistances, these approaches may create a circulating power as well as overstressing the ICs in the case of employing multiple ICs for interconnecting the ac and dc subgrids. This paper proposes an autonomous power sharing approach for hybrid microgrids interconnected through multiple ICs by introducing a superimposed frequency in the dc subgrid. Hence, a suitable droop approach is presented to manage the power among the dc and ac sources as well as ICs. The outcomes are proportional power sharing, preventing circulating power and overstressing the ICs as well as acceptable dc voltage regulation. Furthermore, the maximum transferred power by the ICs can be improved by employing the proposed approach. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated by simulation.},

The simplest solution allows linking a three-phase AC grid using only two single-phase inverters. However, it can be extended with the purpose to make a multilevel converter. The solution allows to transfer the energy in a way that supports the attenuation of the voltage unbalance that can appear in the DC microgrid(s).

  abstract = {The analysis of the small-signal stability of conventional power systems is well established, but for inverter based microgrids there is a need to establish how circuit and control features give rise to particular oscillatory modes and which of these have poor damping. This paper develops the modeling and analysis of autonomous operation of inverter-based microgrids. Each sub-module is modeled in state-space form and all are combined together on a common reference frame. The model captures the detail of the control loops of the inverter but not the switching action. Some inverter modes are found at relatively high frequency and so a full dynamic model of the network (rather than an algebraic impedance model) is used. The complete model is linearized around an operating point and the resulting system matrix is used to derive the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues (termed ``modes'') indicate the frequency and damping of oscillatory components in the transient response. A sensitivity analysis is also presented which helps identifying the origin of each of the modes and identify possible feedback signals for design of controllers to improve the system stability. With experience it is possible to simplify the model (reduce the order) if particular modes are not of interest as is the case with synchronous machine models. Experimental results from a microgrid of three 10-kW inverters are used to verify the results obtained from the model.},

This paper proposes a new CB-PWM strategy for a three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) converter, which is based on a zero-sequence voltage injection. By inclusion of the zero-sequence voltage, the sinusoidal-modulation reference is modified to 1) carry out the voltage-balancing task of the dc-link capacitors, with no additional control effort, 2) reduce the switching losses, and 3) reduce the low-frequency voltage oscillations of the neutral point. The proposed strategy is an alternative approach to the nearest three-vector (NTV) space-vector modulation (SVM) strategy and is obtained by the analysis of the NTV-SVM strategy and establishing a correlation between the NTV-SVM and the CB-PWM strategies. The salient features of the proposed scheme, as compared with the NTV-SVM strategy, are: 1) its reduced computational processing time which is attractive for digital implementation and 2) its reduced switching losses. Compared with the existing CB-PWM strategies, the proposed strategy offers 1) capability to balance the capacitor voltages and reduce the NP voltage oscillations and 2) reduced switching losses. Performance of the proposed CB-PWM strategy for a three-level NPC converter based on time-domain simulation studies in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment is evaluated and also experimentally verified.},

The r-Z-source inverter is capable of providing high voltage gain whilst does not have the drawbacks of the conventional inverters. In this paper, an interconnected AC/DC microgrid is considered in which AC load and sources are connected to AC subgrid and DC load and sources are connected to DC subgrid, therefore power conversion stages are reduced in each subgrid resulting in less volume and cost of power converters and higher efficiency and reliability. In addition, in the DC subgrid, a multiport power electronic interface is employed for interfacing DC distributed generations which are photovoltaic power generation along with a battery unit. The r-Z-source inverter is used as interlinking converter for the AC and DC subgrids and its control scheme is described with respect to the autonomous operation of the hybrid microgrid. Moreover, droop control is used for power sharing management of the microgrid as a decentralized control strategy. The performance of the proposed interlinking converter and control strategy of the autonomous microgrid is evaluated by time domain simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.},

This poses new challenges for distribution network operators, including voltage fluctuations beyond permissible limits that can differ in different parts of the same distribution network. The Hybrid Transformer (HT) is an effective solution that can mitigate voltage fluctuations continuously, dynamically and in a local manner, through combining a standard distribution transformer with a power electronic converter. In this paper a retrofittable HT topology is proposed. It utilises a second, fractionally-rated line frequency transformer (LFT) to enable the use of low-voltage power electronics with low power ratings for reduced costs and complexity. The proposed topology is modelled and a scaled hardware prototype is used to verify theory and simulation results. The simulation and experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed topology, its applicability to mitigate voltage fluctuations, and its benefits over alternative approaches.},

  abstract = {Bipolarity in dc microgrids is desirable as it enhances the system reliability and efficiency. However, a bipolar dc microgrid (BDCMG) demands multiple conventional dc-dc converters to feed power to both the poles of the BDCMG. To handle this requirement and to maintain high efficiency, a new four-port, dual-input-dual-output dc-dc converter topology is proposed for interfacing the solar photovoltaic (PV) and fuel cell sources to a low-voltage BDCMG. The proposed topology is unidirectional, efficient, and compact. It has fewer circuit elements with only one inductor compared to the conventional nonisolated dc-dc converters. The proposed converter regulates one of the pole voltages of the dc bus and also ensures maximum power point tracking of the PV source. Furthermore, the converter can be operated as a single-input-dual-output converter. The control complexity of the proposed converter is low as it can be operated in various modes with only one set of controllers. To design the control system for the proposed converter, a small-signal model is derived for each operating mode. Loss modeling and efficiency analysis of the proposed converter are carried out, and its efficacy and performance are validated by detailed simulation and experimental results under various operating conditions.},

The controllers are implemented with the explicit MPC technique and they are evaluated with a permanent-magnet-synchronous-machine drive system. The steady-state performance is assessed in terms of current quality and switching frequency and the dynamic performance is evaluated estimating the control bandwidth. Although CCS-MPC and FCS-MPC have different characteristics (harmonic spectrum, constant or variable switching frequency, THD, etc.), they achieve similar performance. However, CCS-MPC can work with larger sampling-times, i.e. it has lower requirements on the control architecture. This makes it more versatile for application on different systems and power levels.},

Unlike the conventional efficiency improvement methods, which is based on cumbersome circuit/component optimization and/or modification for a single operating point, this paper proposes a simple approach based on topology transition which can achieve a high efficiency for a wide input voltage range. In particular, the topology of the LED driver can change between buck, boost, and buck-boost converter according to the level of the input voltage. In addition, a novel current mode controller is proposed, such that 1) compatibility to different topologies, 2) seamless topology transition, and 3) fast current reference tracking can be concurrently achieved. The feasibilities of the proposed topology transition method and its control has been experimentally verified through a four-switch buck-boost converter prototype with 7-45 V input, 25 V/1 A LED strings output. It is shown that there is more than 5\% efficiency improvement as compared to the conventional four-switch buck-boost converter. Full range (0\%-100\%) and precise (1\% dimming precision) pulse-width-modulated dimming has also been demonstrated.},

The primary purpose of the multi-microgrid operation is to share required active/reactive power among multiple microgrids. In order to achieve this objective interlinking converters of each microgrid is designed with embedded droop controllers. The conventional droop controllers are replaced with proportional-derivative (PD) compensated droop controllers. The PD compensated droop controller ensures proper damping and avoids the limitations of power sharing accuracy associated with the conventional droop controllers during islanded to multi-microgrid mode transition. A simplified centralized MMOC has been designed to control the initiation and the termination period of the multi-microgrid operation. The MMOC also generates necessary reference signals for the interlinking converters to achieve successful multi-microgrid operation among multiple hybrid AC/DC microgrids. Two islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrids are designed in MATLAB/ SIMULINK environment based on N44 and N05 buildings in Griffith University, Australia. The PD compensated droop method has been embedded into the interlinking voltage source inverter (VSI) controllers of each microgrids. Simulation has been carried out for islanded mode, multi-microgrid operational mode and the transition between these two modes under variable loading and three-phase fault condition. All the simulation results show that the designed controller provides superior and robust performance for variable scenarios.},

It is shown that the performance of DC/DC converter depends not only on its active power, but also on nonactive power that flows inside the converter and the nonactive power drained from source and/or supplied to the load. To demonstrate it, the nonactive power is evaluated on a partial active power buck-boost converter and a new approach is proposed to quantify the total power handled by a DC/DC power converter. Experimental results are presented in order to confirm the analysis.},

  abstract = {The purpose of controlling the vehicle handling is to ensure that the vehicle is in a safe condition and following its desire path. Vehicle yaw rate is controlled in order to achieve a good vehicle handling. In this paper, the optimal Composite Nonlinear Feedback (CNF) control technique is proposed for an Active Front Steering (AFS) system for improving the vehicle yaw rate response. The model used in order to validate the performance of controller is nonlinear vehicle model with 7 degree-of-freedom (DOF) and a bicycle model is implemented for the purpose of designing the controller. In designing an optimal CNF controller, the parameter estimation of linear and nonlinear gain becomes very important to produce the best output response. An intelligent algorithm is designed to minimize the time consumed to get the best parameter. To design an optimal method, Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) is utilized to optimize the CNF controller performance. As a result, transient performance of the yaw rate has improved with the increased speed of in tracking and searching of the best optimized parameter estimation for the linear and the nonlinear gain of CNF controller.\^A~\^A},

  abstract = {Due to the easy accessibility of highly efficient PV panels that minimize negative environmental effects, solar photovoltaic (PV) power systems are presently used as a significant alternative power source. The household PV power plants in use are often linked together in strings or arrays before being in a grid-connected state or a load using an inverter. The research is done with the PV plant, which comprises six panels, each having a 250 Wp rating, linked in series to produce 1.5 kWp of rated power and then connected to the load through an inverter. A multiple PWM approach is employed in this system to regulate an inverter's switches. The system's main flaw is that it suffers a production loss of roughly 60\% if any external elements, such a chimney or a tree, cast any shade onto one or more panels. In the proposed system, a cascaded boost converter with sliding mode control is designed to match the PV panel's source and load characteristics even while it is being shadowed by outside influences. The MATLAB/SIMULINK environment is used to model the proposed system. The system is linked to the load after the system's output from the cascaded boost converter roughly 30 V DC which is connected in series with the other five panels to create a string of 180 V DC. Using an LM318 comparator, a boost converter with sliding mode control is realized. The converter's output ranges from 28 to 30 volts. As a result, the entire system power is increased by around 30\%.},

  abstract = {Partial power converters, also know as fractional or differential power converters among other terminologies, is a very attractive concept that has gained an increasing attention during the last decades. Through a rearrangement of the traditional power conversion structures, the converter only processes a fraction of the total power while the rest is directly transmitted to the load. Consequently, a significant reduction in size and cost of the converter is achieved through the use of low-power ratings devices, allowing also higher efficiencies. Partial power converters have been proposed for various applications, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems. In PV applications single-phase grid-connected PV inverter are composed usually by two-stage power conversion, a full power DC-DC converter and a hard-switched high frequency PWM inverter. Although, different DC-DC partial power converter have been proposed as a first stage, most of the existing solutions deals with constant DC-DC regulation voltage, then the DC-AC grid tied inverter stage still requires to perform all the inversion through hard-switched PWM strategy. In this paper a partial power unfolding dc-dc stage is proposed, which generates a rectified sinusoidal current, leaving only the unfolding duty to the inverter stage. As a result, only one hard-switched PWM partial power stage composes the system, increasing the efficiency. The proposed partial power inverter is applied on a 3.3kW PV string inverter. Simulation results are provide to verify the interest of the proposed partial power DC-AC inverter.},

Several works in the state of the art propose control strategies to optimize synthetic inertia performance; however, most of the performance metrics indirectly represent frequency control adequacy indicators such as rate of change of frequency or frequency nadir. Also, control definitions assume that there is one variable speed wind turbine and one controller, which limits the applicability of the proposals as power systems normally count with various wind turbines/farms over extended geographical areas with different wind regimes. This work presents a H{$_2$} optimal control approach for a variable speed wind turbine synthetic inertia controller. First, the objective of the formulation is to explicitly minimize the rate of change of power system frequency. Second, a stability proof for the multi-wind turbine case is proposed, allowing optimal controllers to be independently implemented for an arbitrary number of wind turbines and wind regimes. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated with a numerical example, considering an empirically-validated, reduced-order model of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas frequency dynamics.},

The proposed bipolar dc structure reduces the step-down effort on the dc--dc fast chargers. In addition, this paper proposes a balancing mechanism that allows handling any difference on the dc loads while keeping the midpoint voltage accurately regulated. By formally defining the unbalance operation limit, the proposed control scheme is able to provide complementary balancing capabilities by the use of an additional NPC leg acting as a bidirectional dc--dc stage, simulating the minimal load condition and allowing the modulator to keep the control on the dc voltages under any load scenario. The proposed solution enables fast charging for PEVs concentrating several charging units into a central grid-tied converter. In this paper, simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed charging station architecture.},

The high penetration of distributed generators, linked to the grid through highly controllable power processors based on power electronics, together with the incorporation of electrical energy storage systems, communication technologies, and controllable loads, opens new horizons to the effective expansion of microgrid applications integrated into electrical power systems. This paper carries out an overview about microgrid structures and control techniques at different hierarchical levels. At the power converter level, a detailed analysis of the main operation modes and control structures for power converters belonging to microgrids is carried out, focusing mainly on grid-forming, grid-feeding, and grid-supporting configurations. This analysis is extended as well toward the hierarchical control scheme of microgrids, which, based on the primary, secondary, and tertiary control layer division, is devoted to minimize the operation cost, coordinating support services, meanwhile maximizing the reliability and the controllability of microgrids. Finally, the main grid services that microgrids can offer to the main network, as well as the future trends in the development of their operation and control for the next future, are presented and discussed.},

Predictive Torque Control (PTC) has been developed to control induction motor drives, allowing high-performance and fast dynamics. However, the optimization used in PTC is based on a single cost function minimization, where control objectives are merged by using weighting factors. The adjustment of these factors is achieved through a nontrivial process and they are heavily dependent on the system parameters and user requirements, being a complex task in systems where two or three weighting factors must be adjusted. To avoid the well-known time-consuming simulations and branch and bound search process, a Multiobjective Fuzzy Predictive Torque Control (FPTC) is presented for a Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped voltage source inverter (3L-NPC). The proposed strategy changes the single cost function with a Multiobjective Optimization based on Fuzzy-Decision-Making. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the behavior of the motor drive under steady-state and dynamic conditions.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an interleaved partial power converter (PPC) for the DC-DC conversion stage of electric vehicles (EVs) fast charging stations. The proposed converter topology is based on the H-bridge DC-DC converter. PPC allows the converter to process only a fraction of the total power, the rest being bypassed and directly supplied to the load. This increases the converter efficiency, as only a portion of the power goes through the converter, thus increasing its efficiency. The principle of operation of the proposed PPC is theoretically analyzed. Simulations of the behavior of the proposed PPC are provided for the charging of an EV battery. Results show the good behavior of the proposed system. It is in particular verified that the proposed converter only process a fraction of the power around 36\% for the entire output power range. Comparison with a classical full power converter is provided showing that the proposed topology leads to a significant improvement in terms of conversion efficiency, from 95.1\% to 98.3\%.},

  abstract = {A new control scheme for parallel-connected inverters taking into account the effect of line impedance is presented. The system presented here consists of two single-phase inverters connected in parallel. The control technique is based on instantaneous average current-sharing control that requires interconnections among inverters for information sharing. A generalized model of a single-phase parallel-connected inverter system is derived. The model incorporates the detail of the control loops that use a proportional-resonant controller, but not the switching action. The voltage- and current-controller design and parameters selection process are discussed. Adaptive gain scheduling is introduced to the controller to improve the current and power sharing for a condition, where the line impedance is different among the inverters. The simulation results show that the adaptive gain-scheduling approaches introduced improve the performance of conventional controller in terms of current and power sharing between inverters under difference line impedance condition. The experiments validate the proposed system performance.},

Specifically, the FCS-MPC problem is designed such that it either limits the losses per semiconductor device or the three-phase converter losses.

  abstract = {Long rides on irregular roads and infrastructure problems like uncomfortable seating have a very bad impact on human body. The passengers suffer not only physical pain but also stress related problems. Airsprings gain more popularity in passenger vehicles with an increase in demand for ride comfort. Ride comfort and vehicle handling, being the two critical factors of a suspension system often contradict each other. This led to an extensive research on active automobile suspension systems. The authors of this article propose an innovative design of adaptive air suspension system with LQR control strategy. The proposed LQR controller is tuned by Particle Swarm Optimization. A dynamic model of an air suspension system used in passenger vehicles was designed and simulated for both passive and adaptive systems in MATLAB. An experimental evaluation was done to check the performance of the adaptive air suspension system on a vibration shaker table. Air suspension is a non-linear system and thus the authors have derived a stiffness equation for the same with minimal assumptions. A comparative analysis between the most commonly used PID controller and proposed LQR controller was performed over bumps, potholes and ISO standard random roads in MATLAB. Simulation results showed that adaptive air suspension system improves the ride comfort by reducing the maximum displacement amplitude of the vehicle over random roads by 31\% while ensuring the stability of the vehicle by reducing the settling time by 85\%. The experimental results of an adaptive air suspension system subjected to random vibrations of frequencies between 5 Hz to 20 Hz, exhibited a reduction of sprung mass acceleration by about 30\% demonstrating that the proposed controller is effective for random vibration inputs.},

Different operation modes of the proposed architecture are discussed, testified, and validated experimentally. The buck--boost capability of the proposed topology allows an enhanced flexibility to integrate various sources with distinct voltage-current (V--I) characteristics while sharing load power among all ports. In this context, steady state analysis is performed to determine the voltage gains between all ports.

  abstract = {Nowadays, interface converters based hybrid AC/DC microgrids have gained great interests in smart grids. The interface converters can perform tasks such as accurate power sharing, power quality enhancement, bidirectional power transmission, and so on by using advanced and accurate control strategies. In this work, a dc voltage droop based hierarchical control is introduced for bidirectional power transfer by an interface converter in a hybrid AC/DC microgrid. This proposed approach can exchange active power between AC or DC subgrids according to the requirement of each subgrid with slight DC voltage deviation around its nominal value. Moreover, a reactive power control algorithm is presented which can compensate the reactive power of the AC subgrid based on the interface converter's maximum rated capacity. Also, the impact of the participation of electric vehicles in the DC subgrid on the improvement of reactive power management and the capacity reduction of the interface converter is investigated. Another droop control is considered in the voltage control loop of the bidirectional boost converter in the electric vehicle to determine the participation rate of the electric vehicle in reactive power management through the charging and discharging of its battery storage system. The simulation results in Simulink MATLAB software illustrate that the compensation of reactive power by the interface converter improves significantly by employing the proposed control method and the maximum participation of electric vehicles, leading to a decrease in the rated capacity of the interface converter.},

  abstract = {In this article, a coordination-based power management strategy based on the concept of consensus algorithm and consensus index for hybrid ac/dc microgrid is proposed for achieving three objectives: 1) accurate and precise active/reactive power sharing between all ac distributed generations (DGs) in the ac subgrid, ac voltage regulation, and ac frequency restoration; 2) accurate and precise power/current sharing between all dc DGs in dc subgrid and dc voltage regulation; 3) accurate power sharing among all the participating ac/dc DGs in the hybrid ac/dc microgrid. The distributed secondary control within the ac/dc subgrids generates the consensus index, and the power management inside the two subgrids is achieved via the distributed control and the consensus index. Moreover, the bidirectional interlinking converter (BIC) control effectively operates with solely two consensus indexes, one from each ac/dc subgrid. Using these two consensus indexes, BIC establishes a dynamic interconnection between all participating DGs within the respective ac/dc subgrids, facilitating seamless power management among them. Compared to the existing strategies, the proposed strategy achieves accurate and proportional power sharing between all the participating ac and dc DGs in the system, rather than only achieving accurate and proportionate power sharing inside the two subgrids. Finally, the proposed power management strategy can considerably reduce communication data, complexity, and bandwidth.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a consensus-based distributed control strategy for optimal power dispatch, frequency control, and DC voltage regulation in islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrids (HMGs). For the primary control, local control of AC/DC DGs is implemented using the droop-based control. Regarding the secondary control, a coordination-based distributed optimal control approach is initially introduced. Subsequently, control objectives, including AC frequency restoration, DC voltage regulation, and optimal economic operation of all participating AC/DC DGs with power limit consideration in the hybrid AC/DC microgrid, are achieved based on the proposed optimal consensus based controller. Moreover, the proposed controller integrates frequency regulation with optimal dispatch, reactive marginal dispatch with voltage regulation in AC microgrid (MG), and optimal dispatch with voltage regulation in DC MG, all at the secondary control level, eliminating the need for a tertiary controller. Furthermore, a distributed active power control method is proposed for managing multiple bi-directional interlinking converters (BICs), ensuring proportional active power sharing for BICs to prevent overloading. Extensive simulations are conducted using MATLAB/Simulink to showcase the effectiveness of the suggested coordination-based control.},

  abstract = {The changes in the distribution network load will affect the distribution network voltage, so the hybrid distribution transformer (HDT) needs to start or stop the load voltage compensation equipment according to the specific load situation. Due to the disadvantage of commonly used voltage rise and fall detection algorithms, this paper proposes a novel dq0 transformation detection algorithm, which takes the derivative of each phase voltage to construct a virtual three-phase voltage, and then performs dq0 transformation on three sets of virtual three-phase voltages. Finally, through simple logical judgment, the detection of single-phase power supply voltage drops and other conditions can be achieved. The advantage of this algorithm is that it only requires the addition of a filter with a smaller time constant to filter out higher-order harmonics, effectively avoiding the delay caused by the larger filter time constant in traditional detection algorithms, thereby improving the real-time and accuracy of detection. The simulation verification of the improved detection algorithm is implemented with the Saber simulation platform about the start and stop of the load voltage compensation device based on the detection signal.},

The proposed converter consists of two DCXs operating at the unregulated state and a nonisolated dc--dc converter for the system output voltage regulation. The primary sides of the two DCXs are integrated by sharing a common bridge arm, and the merging of the secondary side components can be realized by the series connection of the secondary windings, which is beneficial to reduce the number and cost of components. The partial power processing is realized with different input voltages of the two bridge arms of DCX1, and the power handled by the voltage regulator can be reduced furtherly by the two transformers. In order to minimize the total power loss furtherly, the genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to realize parameter optimization.

  abstract = {Reducing switching losses through resonance is an effective way to improve the efficiency of a solar power optimizer. In fact, in comparison with the traditional converters, the resonance-based solar power optimizer can offer considerable reliability and efficiency at reduced cost if unnecessary elements in its configuration are removed. In this article, a new photovoltaic boost power optimizer is introduced based on the resonance between the converter inductor and the output capacitance of the MOSFET leading to a reduction in the switching losses of the MOSFET. Using this method, the cost of the converter decreases compared with traditional methods that employ additional elements to use the resonance in the system. In the proposed converter, the MOSFET is switched on when the resonant voltage across it reaches zero or a minimum value; therefore, the switching losses decrease significantly. Also, the proposed boost power optimizer operates in a critical conduction mode (CRM) to decrease the switching losses. In addition to the reduction of MOSFET switching losses, other losses consisting of inductor copper loss, diode conduction loss, and conducting loss of MOSFET are reduced so that converter efficiency increases considerably. The proposed technique is experimentally validated using a prototype. Experimental results demonstrated that the efficiency of the boost power optimizer is as high as 98\%.},

  abstract = {Series-connected partial power converters (S-PPCs) present the advantage of reduced losses due to part of the load power be delivered without any processing, i.e., losslessly. The remaining amount of processed power is required to offer load voltage or current regulation and it is subject of switching and conduction losses. Hence, the efficiency of an S-PPC is quite dependent on keeping its voltage regulation range ( \textbackslash Delta v) as narrow as possible. For electric vehicles battery chargers, \textbackslash Delta v must cover from discharged to full charged traction battery pack voltage values, which often cover a wide voltage range and, thus, may minimize the benefits in employing S-PPC. To maintain the S-PPC advantages for such a wider voltage regulation range, this article proposes a step-up/down S-PPC with a reconfigurable H-bridge and variable turns ratio for the dc--dc stage of an integrated on-board charger (OBC). This way, \textbackslash Delta v is split into multiple regions, covering from narrow to wider portions that allows the design of the S-PPC to be optimized for the narrow \textbackslash Delta v during most of the constant current charging mode. This feature provides a significant efficiency improvement and it is achieved by using a tapped primary winding that allows the PWM switching pattern to be exchanged among the three primary-side H-bridge legs yielding in a set of three distinct transformer turns ratios specially designed to cover each region of \textbackslash Delta v and reducing the current through the S-PPC. In addition, zero-current switching is achieved for the primary switches and zero-voltage switching for the secondary switches, which are ensured via two fixed-frequency modulation strategies, i.e., without any additional circuit component to suppress the high-voltage spikes across the primary switches. To validate the analyzes, a scale-down prototype was built for an OBC application example (2.2 kW), reaching a peak efficiency of 98.7\% during charging.},

The resulting controllers feature efficient drive operation without the necessity of an a priori known plant model but, so far, conduction of the corresponding training phase in real-world drive systems has been applied only sparsely due to safety concerns. This contribution targets the challenging problem of self-learning torque control for a permanent-magnet synchronous motor assuming a finite control set, i.e., the direct selection of switching actions instead of a modulator-based setup. In order to allow a secure and effective online training with real-world drive systems, the RL controller is monitored by a safeguarding algorithm that prevents application of unsafe switching actions, e.g., such that result in overcurrent. The accruing amount of measurement data is handled with the use of an edge-computing pipeline to outsource the RL training from the embedded control hardware. The inference of the utilized artificial neural network in hard real time is realized with the use of a reconfigurable field-programmable gate array architecture. The resulting RL-based algorithm is able to learn a torque control policy in just 10 min, which has been validated during comprehensive real-world experiments.},

In this paper, a model predictive control strategy without using any proportional-integral-derivative (PID) regulators is proposed. The proposed strategy consists of a model predictive current and power (MPCP) control scheme and a model predictive voltage and power (MPVP) control method. By controlling the bidirectional dc-dc converter of the battery energy storage system based on the MPCP algorithm, the fluctuating output from the renewable energy sources can be smoothed while stable dc-bus voltage can be maintained. Meanwhile, the ac/dc interlinking converter is controlled by using the MPVP scheme to ensure stable ac voltage supply and proper power flow between the microgrid and the utility grid. Then, a system-level energy management scheme is developed to ensure stable operation under different operation modes by considering fluctuating power generation, variable power demand, battery state of charge, and electricity price. Compared with the traditional cascade control, the proposed method is simpler and shows better performance, which is validated in simulation based on a 3.5-MW PV-wind-battery system with real-world solar and wind profiles.},

Frequency responses of the closed-loop control-to-output and output impedance are selected as the metrics of the ability in voltage tracking and the load disturbance rejection performance. The frequency response plots of the closed-loop control-to-output transfer function and output impedance of each control method are theoretically derived or swept using simulation software PLECS and MATLAB.

  abstract = {This paper present the finite-state predictive power control (FS-PPC) for the interlinking converter in the micro-grid. The proportional-integral (PI) based controllers are dynamically slower for the sudden changes in the power reference values. The phase lock loop (PLL) is essential requirement for such algorithms. The FS-PPC has faster dynamic response as compare to PI based controller in tracking the reference values. The FS-PPC is proposed to control the power flow between the DC and AC micro-grids. The developed control provides the constant switching frequency operation for the interlinking converter which reduces the ripples and total harmonic distortion of the grid current in order to follow the grid codes. Simulation results are provided for the validity of the control algorithm.},

  abstract = {Poor power management of bidirectional interlinking converter (BIC) and sub-grids in a hybrid AC/DC microgrid can lead to a heavy or light load state of some distributed energy resources (DERs), and large deviations of AC bus voltage/frequency and DC bus voltage. This study proposes a distributed power management strategy based on the concept of coordination factors for hybrid microgrids to achieve accurate active power sharing among all AC/DC DERs (instead of the same within one sub-grid), reactive power sharing among AC DERs, and AC voltage/frequency and DC voltage restorations. Power management within a sub-grid is achieved by following the leader DER with the maximum coordination factor. Meanwhile, the BIC can establish a dynamic connection among all DERs by tracking the leaders of each sub-grid to realize power management between sub-grids. Compared to conventional methods, the proposed method can achieve accurate power sharing and voltage/frequency restorations simultaneously. Additionally, communication data and bandwidth can be significantly reduced. Finally, hardware-in-loop experiments are also performed to prove the feasibility of the proposed strategy, even during communication latency or failure.},

  abstract = {By combining partially rated converters with electromagnetic transformers, hybrid transformers can manage voltage and power flow in ac grids while enabling a variety of application expansions. For instance, dc bias in ac grids can lead to several detrimental impacts, and the existing suppression methods typically require supplementary equipment. However, hybrid transformers can achieve dc bias suppression by modifying their control strategies without any extra demands. The direct dc output control signal will lead to unbalanced arm power accumulation in hybrid transformers employing modular multilevel converters with half-bridge submodules, eventually causing the converter blocked. This letter proposes a novel asymmetric operation mode of hybrid transformers for dc bias suppression, being able to output a continuous and stable dc component without incurring any additional cost. It also avoids impacting the basic functions of hybrid transformers for voltage management and dc integration. Finally, the proposed operation method has been validated through simulations and experiments. The proposed operation approach is not solely aimed at achieving converter optimization, but rather to serve the specific needs of dc bias in ac grids, expanding the functionality of the hybrid transformers further.},

The impacts of frequency and voltage offset caused by load fluctuation have not been considered in the existing control strategies of autonomous microgrid, such as droop control, master-slave control, and average current-sharing control. To address this issue, an improved adaptive peer-to-peer droop control strategy is proposed herein, which is applicable to hybrid AC/DC microgrid in islanding operation mode. Moreover, the corresponding power flow model and solution algorithm are established. The improved control strategy performs well with any load fluctuation, which can not only allocate active power imbalance according to the capacity ratio of all DGs to protect them from overload, but also it is able to maintain frequency and voltage stability in a further step. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method is validated using a bunch of test results on a modified autonomous hybrid AC/DC microgrid.},

Tuning of the voltage controller provides a simple and intuitive tradeoff between the conflicting goals of voltage regulation and reactive power sharing. Our designs require no knowledge of the microgrid topology, impedances, or loads. The distributed architecture allows for flexibility and redundancy, eliminating the need for a central microgrid controller.

We show that a network of loads and DC/AC inverters equipped with power-frequency droop controllers can be cast as a Kuramoto model of phase-coupled oscillators. This novel description, together with results from the theory of coupled oscillators, allows us to characterize the behavior of the network of inverters and loads. Specifically, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a synchronized solution that is unique and locally exponentially stable. We present a selection of controller gains leading to a desirable sharing of power among the inverters, and specify the set of loads which can be serviced without violating given actuation constraints. Moreover, we propose a distributed integral controller based on averaging algorithms, which dynamically regulates the system frequency in the presence of a time-varying load. Remarkably, this distributed-averaging integral controller has the additional property that it preserves the power sharing properties of the primary droop controller. Our results hold for any acyclic network topology, and hold without assumptions on identical line admittances or voltage magnitudes.},

During outage and low renewable power generation, it synchronizes with the DG set to meet the load demand and forms a hybrid microgrid.

VSCs in large interconnected micro- grids may use non-communication based droop control to share total power demand in the ratio of their droop coefficients. However, a constant droop ratio restricts the power delivery capability of the VSCs although surplus power may be available in their respective sources. In this paper, along with a unified power management strategy for intra and inter microgrid power sharing in a hybrid AC-DC MMG system, a novel adaptive droop control algorithm is presented that dynamically changes droop coefficients of the VSCs to ensure maximum utilization of available resources in each microgrid under different operating modes. Stability analysis of the proposed control method is performed and comparison of the system performance with fixed and adaptive droop ratio is illustrated by simulating the MMG in MATLAB SIMULINK using real solar irradiance field data. It is validated from simulation results that the adaptive droop control method increases utilization of renewable energy sources within microgrids and reduces energy import from utility grid.},

It allows for a full parallel connection of multiple inverters simultaneously on both the ac and dc sides, offering high modularity, redundancy, expandability, and overall system reliability. A generic dynamical system model is derived, considering the coupling effects between parallelized inverters, physical constraints, and varying grid impedance. A decentralized proportional-integral state feedback control (PI-SFC) with an extended Luenberger state observer is developed and compared with a conventional PI controller regulating inverter-side currents. A stability analysis shows that both closed-loop control systems remain stable even if an arbitrarily large number of inverters are connected in parallel. Simulations and experiments confirm the functionality and robustness of the closed-loop system under varying grid impedances and during grid faults. For the experimental results, the controllers were implemented on commercially available hardware of the proposed topology. In particular, the PI-SFC allows for better exploitation of the full power of the inverters due to its enhanced controller performance and damping ability. Besides, the exceptional match between simulation and experimental results proves the accuracy of the proposed system model as well.},

  abstract = {In microgrid applications, LC-filtered voltage source inverters are popular for their low harmonic output and compact design. The high order characteristic and coupling effect of this inverter calls for advanced control scheme, where finite control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) emerges as a potential alternative among various solutions. However, the FCS-MPC paradigm needs an accurate math model to predict control variables while traditional modeling methods are vulnerable to system parameter variations. To cope with this challenge, a newly developed data-enabled FCS-MPC approach is put forward in this paper. By leveraging the dynamic linearization technique, it constructs a mathematical model only based on input and output data, eliminating the need for specific circuit parameters. This approach not only retains the advantages of traditional model predictive control but also demonstrates superior performance in handling system parameter changes and disturbances. The robustness of the proposed method in tracking ability and adaptation to parameter mismatches is verified by comparative simulation tests and experiments on a three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter. Meanwhile, the influence of different linearization constants on control performance is investigated, providing strong support for the practical application of this control approach.},

  abstract = {Today, interests on hybrid ac/dc microgrids, which contain the advantages of both ac and dc microgrids, are growing rapidly. In the hybrid ac/dc microgrid, the parallel-operated ac/dc bidirectional interfacing converters (IFCs) are increasingly used for large capacity renewable energy sources or as the interlinking converters between the ac and dc subsystems. When unbalanced grid faults occur, the active power transferred by the parallel-operated IFCs must be kept constant and oscillation-free to stabilize the dc bus voltage. However, under conventional control strategies in unbalanced grid conditions, the active power transfer capability of IFCs is affected due to the converters' current rating limitations. Moreover, unbalanced voltage adverse effects on IFCs (such as output power oscillations, dc-link ripples, and output current enhancement) could be amplified by the number of parallel converters. Therefore, this paper investigates parallel operation of IFCs in hybrid ac/dc microgrids under unbalanced ac grid conditions and proposes a novel control strategy to enhance the active power transfer capability with zero active power oscillation. The proposed control strategy employs a new current sharing method which introduces adjustable current reference coefficients for parallel IFCs. In the proposed control strategy, only one IFC, named as redundant IFC, needs to be designed and installed with higher current rating to ensure the constant and oscillation-free output active power of parallel IFCs. Simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

Based on the obtained expressions in {$\alpha\beta$} domain, an EKF is developed to track both the in-phase and quadrature sinusoidal signals together with the unknown frequency.

  abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic population-based algorithm motivated by intelligent collective behavior of birds. The performance of the PSO algorithm highly depends on choosing appropriate parameters. Inertia weight is a parameter of this algorithm which was first proposed by Shi and Eberhart to bring about a balance between the exploration and exploitation characteristics of PSO. This paper presents an adaptive approach which determines the inertia weight in different dimensions for each particle, based on its performance and distance from its best position. Each particle will then have different roles in different dimensions of the search environment. By considering the stability condition and an adaptive inertia weight, the acceleration parameters of PSO are adaptively determined. The corresponding approach is called stability-based adaptive inertia weight (SAIW). The proposed method and some other models for adjusting the inertia weight are evaluated and compared. The efficiency of SAIW is validated on 22 static test problems, moving peaks benchmarks (MPB) and a real-world problem for a radar system design. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model greatly improves the PSO performance in terms of the solution quality as well as convergence speed in static and dynamic environments.},

  abstract = {The modern power system is progressing from a synchronous machine-based system towards an inverter-dominated system, with large-scale penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) like wind and photovoltaics. RES units today represent a major share of the generation, and the traditional approach of integrating them as grid following units can lead to frequency instability. Many researchers have pointed towards using inverters with virtual inertia control algorithms so that they appear as synchronous generators to the grid, maintaining and enhancing system stability. This paper presents a literature review of the current state-of-the-art of virtual inertia implementation techniques, and explores potential research directions and challenges. The major virtual inertia topologies are compared and classified. Through literature review and simulations of some selected topologies it has been shown that similar inertial response can be achieved by relating the parameters of these topologies through time constants and inertia constants, although the exact frequency dynamics may vary slightly. The suitability of a topology depends on system control architecture and desired level of detail in replication of the dynamics of synchronous generators. A discussion on the challenges and research directions points out several research needs, especially for systems level integration of virtual inertia systems.},

Experimental tests are performed on an example converter with a dedicated modulation strategy. The test results confirm the concept in terms of flexible conversion, high power density, low leakage currents, as well as controllable power flow.},

  abstract = {As the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) approach is applied extensively in the system control of automobile suspension, the accuracy improvement of the weighting Q and R matrices is getting concern. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is being introduced to identify parameters and optimize matrix Q and R in order to fix the insufficiency of these experienced values because of the fast convergence and a more accurate solution. In this article, a quarter car model and a Bouc-Wen-based magnetorheological (MR) damper model are developed to combine the control of PSO identification and PSO-LQR controller in the semi-active suspension system. The MR damper was performed with an experimental test for running identification using experimental data as input into the Bouc-Wen model to obtain six unknown parameters, where the parameters were estimated with the PSO algorithm. Since the numerical model has been done with all parameters clear, the need for damping force from suspension is obtained by means of running the model using an input current. In the employment of PSO for damper model and vehicle control, the dual applications succeeded in verifying the feasibility of parameter identification in the MR damper and successfully tuned the LQR controller in the semi-active suspension, which decreases the vehicle body acceleration and displacement so that the improvement of ride comfort and drive stability achieved.},

  abstract = {As the power level of battery energy storage systems (BESS) increases, the issues of low efficiency and low power density resulting from the high power demands of traditional full power converters (FPC) become more apparent. To solve them, a four-quadrant buck-boost partial power converter (PPC) is proposed, in which the internal DC/DC of the converter flows only a small portion of the total power, while the remaining power is transferred directly between the battery and the DC bus through the feedforward path. This paper examines the performance evaluation methods of the PPC from various perspectives. It describes the advantages and limitations of the four-quadrant buck-boost PPC, and presents a design for the topology and control strategy based on a CLLC resonant circuit. Through simulation, the automatic operation of the converter in all four modes is achieved. The proposed is compared to the FPC under the same operating conditions, and the paper highlights the advantages of the four-quadrant buck-boost PPC in terms of efficiency, power density, active and nonactive power, and component stress.},

A proper control structure with robust and reliable control strategies is required to improve the interconnected microgrid's (IMG) performance concerning power sharing, power quality, and stability. Therefore, this paper presents a control structure for power flow control among interconnected hybrid microgrids (HMGs), with particular emphasis on the control strategies of three converters: the energy storage system (ESS), the HMG's interlinking converter (ILC), and the IMG's interconnecting converter (IC). Firstly, a V-f droop control-based ILC control strategy is designed to attain power sharing between AC and DC MGs in HMG while regulating both AC and DC voltages. Secondly, the control strategy of ESS combines a virtual inertia concept with a state of charge-based management to manage charging and discharging according to the IMG power flow and operating modes. Finally, the control strategy of a parallel IC structure based on double-loop voltage control is proposed to interconnect and control the power sharing and DC voltages of HMGs. The IMG system is designed in MATLAB/Simulink, and the performance is validated using the OPAL-RT simulator-based real-time software-in-the-loop simulation technique. The results indicate that the control structure, with three control strategies, ensures reliable performance in all modes and also maximizes power supply security.},

The synthesis of HAC is inspired by the complementary benefits of the dc-based matching and ac-based grid-forming controls as well as ideas from direct angle control and nonlinear damping assignment. The proposed HAC is applied to a nonlinear converter model that is connected to an infinite bus or a center-of-inertia dynamic grid models. We provide parametric sufficient existence, uniqueness, stability, and boundedness conditions that are met by appropriate choice of control parameters. Next, we take into account the safety constraints of power converter, and synthesize a new current-limiting control that is compatible with HAC. Last, we present details on the practical implementation of HAC that are followed by a robustness analysis (which showcases a theory--practice gap), uncover the HAC droop behavior, derive a feedforward-like ac voltage and power control, and illustrate the behavior of the system with simulation case studies.},

The stand-alone control is featured with a complex output voltage controller capable of handling nonlinear load and excess or deficit of generated power. Grid-connection mode with current control is also enabled for the case of isolated local grid involving other dispersed power generators such as other wind turbines or diesel generators. A novel automatic mode switch method based on a phase-locked loop controller is developed in order to detect the grid failure or recovery and switch the operation mode accordingly. A flexible digital signal processor (DSP) system that allows user-friendly code development and online tuning is used to implement and test the different control strategies. The back-to-back power conversion configuration is chosen where the generator converter uses a built-in standard flux vector control to control the speed of the turbine shaft while the grid-side converter uses a standard pulse-width modulation active rectifier control strategy implemented in a DSP controller. The design of the longitudinal conversion loss filter and of the involved PI-controllers are described in detail. Test results show the proposed methods works properly.},

Using the PR controllers, the converter reference tracking performance can be enhanced and previously known shortcomings associated with conventional PI controllers can be alleviated. These shortcomings include steady-state errors in single-phase systems and the need for synchronous d--q transformation in three-phase systems. Based on similar control theory, PR filters can also be used for generating the harmonic command reference precisely in an active power filter, especially for single-phase systems, where d--q transformation theory is not directly applicable. Another advantage associated with the PR controllers and filters is the possibility of implementing selective harmonic compensation without requiring excessive computational resources. Given these advantages and the belief that PR control will find wide-ranging applications in grid-interfaced converters, PR control theory is revised in detail with a number of practical cases that have been implemented previously, described clearly to give a comprehensive reference on PR control and filtering.},

State variables can reflect converter system internal characteristics, and state feedback control can effectively improve system performance. Hence, this article proposes a full-state feedback control strategy (FSFC) for the bidirectional the grid-connected converter with LCL filter. On the ac side, the LCL filter-based FSFC strategy is capable of expanding the passive damping configuration by relocating system poles to optimal damping point, which substantially suppresses the resonance peaks without sacrificing dynamic performance. On the dc side, the proposed FSFC method manages to reduce equivalent system model order and thus enhances the performance on dc side voltage regulation. The proposed bidirectional FSFC control method has been compared with existing mainstream control methods. The results show that the proposed method has better dynamic performance and robustness. Finally, the effectiveness of this method has been verified by both simulation and experimental results.},

The grid interfacing converters in the distribution system, such as the distributed generation (DG) interfacing converters or hybrid ac/dc grid interlinking converters, can participate in distribution grid harmonic control. In this paper, two virtual-impedance-based harmonics control methods are developed for grid interfacing voltagesource inverters (VSIs) to improve the power quality of the distribution grid. As the control parameters are designed based on the virtual impedance theory, clear physical meanings are given to explain their impacts on the system. Also, the proposed methods do not rely on the closed loop feedback control and, therefore, are very suitable for VSIs with low switching frequency (such as those for high-power DGs or interlinking converters for hybrid ac/dc systems), whose closed-loop control feedback bandwidth may be limited for harmonic regulation. The influence of system delay and feedback control loop is considered and modeled in the design procedure; thus more accurate virtual impedance control is achieved for low-switching-frequency VSIs. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison of the two methods, including stability and harmonic compensation performance, are given. Their effectiveness is verified by experiment results.},

A general expression set for voltage gain is proposed for the convenience of studying the synthesized topologies. A visualization scheme for the power density of the topology is proposed for the first time. The topology synthesis method offers a fresh perspective for systematically explaining existing topologies. Through the visualization of topology power density, the power density of nonisolated topologies can be quantitatively evaluated. Nonisolated topologies can be systematically synthesized and classified from the perspective of PPP. Using the proposed power density visualization scheme, topologies with higher power density, known as PPP topologies, can be selected. The feasibility of the synthesized topologies and the power density visualization scheme are respectively validated through design and experiment.},

The work reviewed was initially classified into two main categories, based on a set of distinguishing characteristics identified in the control strategies.

A third ad hoc category was also established for the approaches that did not fit in the other two categories. Additionally, secondary topics affecting the control strategies were also analyzed, such as the configuration of DC networks, commonly used control methods and factors, communication system relevance, and finally, the simulation and experimental techniques used for validation. Moreover, this systematic review permitted the identification of current research gaps as well as the proposal of new research lines. The results obtained not only are useful as a guide for researchers, who are starting out in the field, but they also highlight interesting research questions that more experienced researchers can actively pursue.},

The formulation is based on a cost function that matches the measurements to the model formulation and an explicit regularization penalty is added. The term is interpreted as a gain that balances estimation accuracy with noise rejection.

  abstract = {Several Continuous Control Set Model Predictive Control algorithms have been successfully proposed for synchronous motor drive current control applications. The choice of the optimal input for the system results into the resolution of a constrained quadratic programming problem. However, most of the MPC algorithms found in literature do not consider any constraints in the identification of the optimal inputs, mainly because of computational burden limit. In the electric drives field this limitation is particularly strict, since industrial applications requires control frequency higher than 5 kHz. This paper deals with the analysis of an on-line continuous control set MPC which solves in real-time mode the quadratic problem, considering also the input constraints. The input feasible domain is mathematically derived in this paper and the information is properly given to a quadratic programming problem solver. The open-source solver qpOASES run real-time the MPC algorithm on a high performance R\&D hardware, at rate of 6 kHz. The proposed control scheme is applied as current regulator for an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor. The performances achieved with the proposed constrained MPC are compared to those of another MPC that computes only the unconstrained solution, coupled with an over-modulation strategy. Both steady state and transients experimental tests are reported, considering the operating conditions where the voltage constraints are violated.},

  abstract = {In order to alleviate the negative impacts of harmonically distorted grid conditions on inverters, this paper presents a linear quadratic regulator (LQR)-based current control design for an inductive-capacitive-inductive (LCL)-filtered grid-connected inverter. The proposed control scheme is constructed based on the internal model (IM) principle in which a full-state feedback controller is used for the purpose of stabilization and the integral terms as well as resonant terms are augmented into a control structure for the reference tracking and harmonic compensation, respectively. Additionally, the proposed scheme is implemented in the synchronous reference frame (SRF) to take advantage of the simultaneous compensation for both the negative and positive sequence harmonics by one resonant term. Since this leads to the decrease of necessary resonant terms by half, the computation effort of the controller can be reduced. With regard to the full-state feedback control approach for the LCL-filtered grid connected inverter, additional sensing devices are normally required to measure all of the system state variables. However, this causes a complexity in hardware and high implementation cost for measurement devices. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a discrete-time current full-state observer that uses only the information from the control input, grid-side current sensor, and grid voltage sensor to estimate all of the system state variables with a high precision. Finally, an optimal linear quadratic control approach is introduced for the purpose of choosing optimal feedback gains, systematically, for both the controller and full-state observer. The simulation and experimental results are presented to prove the effectiveness and validity of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract = {To benefit from the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in industrial control applications, RL methods can be used for optimal tuning of the classical controllers based on the simulation scenarios of operating conditions. In this study, the Twin Delay Deep Deterministic (TD3) policy gradient method, which is an effective actor-critic RL strategy, is implemented to learn optimal Proportional Integral (PI) controller dynamics from a Direct Current (DC) motor speed control simulation environment. For this purpose, the PI controller dynamics are introduced to the actor-network by using the PI-based observer states from the control simulation environment. A suitable Simulink simulation environment is adapted to perform the training process of the TD3 algorithm. The actor-network learns the optimal PI controller dynamics by using the reward mechanism that implements the minimization of the optimal control objective function. A setpoint filter is used to describe the desired setpoint response, and step disturbance signals with random amplitude are incorporated in the simulation environment to improve disturbance rejection control skills with the help of experience based learning in the designed control simulation environment. When the training task is completed, the optimal PI controller coefficients are obtained from the weight coefficients of the actor-network. The performance of the optimal PI dynamics, which were learned by using the TD3 algorithm and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm, are compared. Moreover, control performance improvement of this RL based PI controller tuning method (RL-PI) is demonstrated relative to performances of both integer and fractional order PI controllers that were tuned by using several popular metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimization and Differential Evolution.},

  abstract = {This work presents control of interlinking converter for adaptive operation of hybrid microgrid. The hybrid microgrid (HMG) consists of canal based small hydro generation combined with solar panel tied at AC bus. A battery-based energy storage unit (ESU) is used, that balances the DC bus voltage whereas the interlinking converter (ILC) balances the AC bus frequency and voltage in the off-grid scenarios. Besides, multimode operation of interlinking converter is also tabulated. In the grid connected mode, the voltages at the PCC are governed by grid hence ILC operates in the current control mode to inject power from distributed energy sources to the grid. While ESU supports the DC bus. The objective of the HMG is that it meets both AC and DC load demand irrespective of the operating modes. The system possesses grid synchronization capability. It is noteworthy to mention that PVC AC/DC converter is used not only to transfer the active power from PV array to the grid but also supports the grid by providing reactive power. The harmonics and reactive power demand of the local loads are met by the ILC. This is accomplished by employing a total least square based adaptive filter. The hybrid microgrid is simulated on a MATLAB/Simulink platform to validate the modes of operation and a comparative analysis w.r.t to other adaptive filters is presented. Lastly, the system is tested on an OPAL-RT based real time simulator.},

Ac and dc buses are adjoined using an interlinking converter (ILC) for bidirectional exchange of power. Depending upon generation and demand, four operating modes of hybrid ac/dc MG are formed, which allow independent operation at both ac and dc bus. Modes are formed to maximize utilization of RESs at their respective buses. Maximum power point algorithms are used to extract maximum power from WECS and solar PV array. Moreover, a filtered-x affine projection Versoria (FxAPV) adaptive filter is employed to extract active and reactive parts of load currents so that stator currents of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) and hydrogenerator are harmonics free. System voltage and frequency of ac bus are controlled using ILC, whereas bidirectional dc--dc converter (BDDC) regulates voltage on dc side. Performance of system is verified on a hardware prototype.},

Distorted source voltages and unbalanced non-linear load currents compensation were verified simultaneously through the 3P4L USPAF system experimental prototype. Sub-harmonic and stochastic non-periodic current/voltage compensations were analyzed through simulations with Matlab/Simulink software. The simulation and experimental results showed that the theory proposed for the 3P4L USPAF system was applicable to non-active power compensation in three-phase four-wire (3P4W) systems under periodic and non-periodic disturbances.},

  abstract = {In this paper different randomness scenarios for the recently developed direct particle swarm controller for repetitive processes are investigated and compared. The proposed controller employs the particle swarm optimizer (PSO) to solve in on-line mode the dynamic optimization problem (DOP) designed to shape the control signal in the constant-amplitude constant-frequency (CACF) voltage source inverter (VSI) with an LC output filter. The controller is of a stochastic nature. The DOP at hand is of {$\alpha$}D dimensionality, where {$\alpha$} denotes the number of control signal samples per each period of the reference voltage signal. Originally, the PSO requires pseudorandom number generators (PRNG) to be run throughout the iterative search to get a new set of numbers in each sample time. In DOP scenarios the swarm has to be kept alive during the operation of the inverter. This in turn implies that the pseudorandom numbers are to be generated in real-time using digital signal controller (DSC) resources. Four different randomization schemes have been tested: the dimension-and-particle-wise one, the dimension-wise one, the particle-wise one and an almost-deterministic one (also known as a list-based PSO). The last approach does not employ any PRNG in real time and as such establishes an appealing alternative in terms of its low computational burden. The effectiveness of such a scheme, when applied to the direct swarm controller, has been studied numerically in the paper.},

The control system consists of three parts: a repetitive feedback controller, a repetitive disturbance feedforward controller and a non-repetitive full-state feedback controller. The repetitive feedback part is synthetized using the recently developed plug-in direct particle swarm repetitive control (PDPSRC) strategy. This approach is free from long-term stability issues encountered in the classical iterative learning control (ILC) schemes. The repetitive disturbance feedforward part is the extension of a non-repetitive disturbance feedforward controller. The repetitiveness of the load current has been harnessed to reduce the influence of the delay introduced by the digital control system. This makes the disturbance feedforward path more effective in comparison to the standard one. The non-repetitive controller is employed here just to increase damping in the system which is naturally significantly underdamped. A standard technique of full-state feedback and pole placement has been used to calculate its gains. The resulting control system has been tested with the help of numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {This paper presents evolutionary optimization of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for a voltage-source inverter with an LC output filter. The procedure involves particle-swarm-based search for the best weighting factors in the quadratic cost function. It is common practice that the weights in the cost function are set using the guess-and-check method. However, it becomes quite challenging, and usually very time-consuming, if there are many auxiliary states added to the system. In order to immunize the system against unbalanced and nonlinear loads, oscillatory terms are incorporated into the control scheme, and this significantly increases the number of weights to be guessed. All controller gains are determined altogether in one LQR procedure call, and the originality reported here refers to evolutionary tuning of the weighting matrix. There is only one penalty factor to be set by the designer during the controller synthesis procedure. This coefficient enables shaping the dynamics of the closed-loop system by penalizing the dynamics of control signals instead of selecting individual weighting factors for augmented state vector components. Simulational tuning and experimental verification (the physical converter at the level of 21 kVA) are included.},

The recently developed plug-in direct multi-swarm repetitive controller (PDMSRC) for the sine wave constant-amplitude constant-frequency (CACF) voltage-source inverter (VSI) with an output LC filter serves as a case study. Online dynamic optimization problems (DOPs), i.e. those solved without switching into some sort of offline/commissioning mode, impose restrictions that are challenging for population-based optimization techniques. In the PDMSRC samples of the control signal are directly stored in the particles. Solutions available for swarms operating in dynamic and noisy environments are briefly discussed and candidates for the PDMSRC are indicated. Geometric versus statistical and cumulative versus dimension-wise diversity measures are tested. The advantages of replacing the frequently used non-dimension-wise repulsion with a dimension-wise mechanism are demonstrated here. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with the help of numerical experiments.},

Initially, the Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) error backpropagation (BP) algorithm was used as a DOP(dynamic optimization problem)-capable search mechanism. At that time the choice of the training algorithm was made based on the frequently reported effectiveness of the L-M method in static optimization problems.

The case study of a constant-amplitude constant-frequency (CACF) voltage-source inverter (VSI) with an LC output filter is analysed here and some recommendations regarding the trade-off between convergence rate and computational complexity are made. The robustness to a measurement noise is also tested. The comparison is based on the results of numerical experiments. A couple of algorithms is then suggested for real-time implementation.},

  abstract = {The majority of the paper is devoted to debunking flawed methods proposed in the literature within the context of multiresonant control systems for grid-connected converters and then a novel approach is proposed. Several flawed approaches to grid tied power electronic converters (rectifiers and shunt active power filters) are discussed to initiate a critical discussion regarding some tuning methods reported in the topical literature. In this paper we analytically show that some of them are even erroneous from the control theory point of view or are based on mathematically erroneous derivations. That is especially prevalent for papers in which the Naslin polynomial method is employed to tune proportional-multiresonant controllers. Some authors recognize that the resulting control systems are not robust, i.e. not practical, and use obtained gains only as a starting point for further tuning using the trial and error method or evolutionary global optimization. Robustness of such systems is often not guaranteed and if it occurs at all, it is by chance or thanks to a combination of luck and expert knowledge of the engineer (not by deliberate design). Therefore, the absence of such a guarantee motivates the search for better ways to tune such controllers. As a result, a practical robust controller tuning method for multiresonant grid current controllers is proposed and verified experimentally. We are convinced that one of the solutions can be based on the disk margin stability analysis and a global search algorithm. The required robustness is expressed as stability margins. The design procedure is very user-friendly and the disk size is the key design parameter to be selected by an engineer. The practicality of the tuning method is demonstrated empirically in a 10 kVA physical grid-tied converter.},

Until now the most used configuration has been the ac microgrid, but dc-based microgrids are gaining interest due to the advantages they provide over their counterpart (no reactive power, no synchronization, increasing number of dc devices, etc.). Therefore, hybrid ac/dc microgrids are raising as an optimal approach as they combine the main advantages of ac and dc microgrids. This paper reviews the most interesting topologies of hybrid ac/dc microgrids based on the interconnection of the ac and dc networks and the conventional power network. After performing a description and analysis of each configuration, a comparative evaluation has been performed to highlight the most important features of each one. The future trends identified during the study also show that several features such as the scalability, modeling or design require further research towards the integration of hybrid microgrids in the power network. \& 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Load and supply parameters may be uncertain in microgrids (MGs) due for instance to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources among others. Guaranteeing reliable and stable MGs despite parameter uncertainties is crucial for their correct operation. Their stability and dynamical features are directly related to the controllers' parameters and power-sharing coefficients. Hence, to maintain power good quality within the desirable range of system parameters and to have a satisfactory response to sudden load changes, careful selection of the controllers and power-sharing coefficients are necessary. In this paper, a simple design approach for the optimal design of controllers' parameters is presented in an islanded MG. To that aim, an optimization problem is formulated based on a small-signal state-space model and solved by three different optimization techniques including particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and a proposed approach based on the combination of both PSO and GA. The optimized coefficients are selected to guarantee desirable static and dynamic responses in a wide range of operations regardless of the number of inverters, system configuration, output impedance differences, and load types. Through the proposed design and tuning method, the performance of the MG is improved as compared to those obtained using state-of-art techniques. This fact is demonstrated by using numerical simulations performed on a detailed model implemented in PSIM\copyright{} software.},

The advantages of the four-wire topology are that by means of a coordinate transformation (Park transformation) it is possible to obtain a decoupled linear model, as well as feeding single-phase and three-phase loads in this operating mode. In the model, two control loops are taken into account: a current loop (controller slave) and a voltage loop (controller master) with the aim that this inverter can regulate its output voltage and when it is supplied to a local load.. The contributions of this work is present in the inverter modeling, the method for obtaining the transfer functions and in the controllers design obtained by this method. The inverter model allows to easily obtain the transfer functions of both loops; this is very important for the control area, considering that using classical control techniques and the methodology proposed in this work, the gains can be obtained directly and not adjusted to trial and error. The main advantage of this proposal is that when the kp and ki gains are obtained through the Bode diagrams, we can obtain generalized integrators; applying the coordinate transformation method to the integral gain that was obtained by the design of the PI controller in direct current (dc); This method is described in detail in the presented work and allows obtaining a new controller called proportional controller plus generalized integrator (P+GI). This controller presents a good performance, since it can follow sinusoidal references, in addition to presenting a better disturbances rejection due to the high gains it presents at the grid frequency and harmonic frequencies of the load.},

The OSS-DPC method belongs to the predictive-DPC family and provides the desired power references by calculating globally OSSs. To address computational and implementation issues, an efficient control algorithm, named reduced OSS-DPC, is introduced.

The aim is to determine a state feedback controller for the small signal model such that it is able to reject perturbations existing on the three-phase currents while keeping the system stable and with a response quick enough. Based on the well-known theory of robust control, a feedback controller is proposed in order to minimize the H{$\infty$} norm of the system while taking in account the variable load and a D-Stability region that will guarantee the speed required for the perturbation effect to decay.

To obtain ZVS with the proposed modulation strategy, the buck+boost inductance is selected and the switches are gated in a way that the inductor current has a negative offset current at the beginning and the end of each pulse period. This allows the MOSFET switches to turn on when the antiparallel body diode is conducting. As the novel modulation strategy is a software-only solution, there are no additional expenses for the active or passive components compared to conventional modulation implementations. Furthermore, an analytical and simulation investigation predicts an excellent efficiency over the complete operating range and a higher power density for a nonisolated multiphase converter equipped with the low-loss modulation. Experimental measurements performed with 12 kW, 17.4 kW/L prototypes in stand-alone and multiphase configuration verify the low-loss operation over a wide output power range and a maximum efficiency of 98.3\% is achieved.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) of power electronic converters has obtained much attention in many applications and especially in electric motor control. As the control loop is closed by predicting the future plant behavior by means of a mathematical model, disturbances and uncertainties are important aspects when using any MPC strategy. The plant model may be inaccurate due to plenty of reasons, such as parameter mismatches or the inverter nonlinearity. If these disturbances are not properly addressed during the MPC design process, the control performance is deteriorated. Hence, a suitable disturbance observer (DOB) is required to compensate for model inaccuracies. This contribution is comparing different lumped-DOB designs in the context of a continuous-control set MPC for induction motor current control. As a baseline for comparison, a field-oriented proportional-integral (PI)-type regulator is utilized which does not require a DOB due to its integral feedback.Comprehensive experimental results prove the necessity of a proper DOB; however, it is also shown that the overall transient and steady-state control improvement due to MPC has to be bought at a high price since the computational burden is at least doubled compared to the PI-baseline.},

In the inverter control layer, a generalized control algorithm is developed to enable the DGs to operate in all three modes (i.e., grid-forming, grid-feeding, and grid-supporting modes) with a single control structure, facilitating the seamless transition between the operating modes. This feature is obtained by designing the multiloop controller in the inverter control layer using inverse plant modeling techniques so that the dynamics of the inverter and the LC filter are fully compensated, virtually transforming the controlled DG in the unity gain from the application layer perspective. Thus, effects of disturbances associated with the mode transitions are thus fully eliminated. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is validated by numerical simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments. The results show that the DGs can fulfill the tasks defined in the system control layer with fast dynamics, desired accuracy, and good transient behavior.},

The direct connection to the LVDC means relatively lower converter capacity, lower switching loss, higher efficiency, and lower cost in HIC. However, the small capacity converter and large capacitive coupling impedance of HIC can lead to a relatively lower reactive power compensation range. Therefore, the practical overcapacity situation may be more likely to occur in HIC, which deteriorates the system performance. To address this issue, the unique P-{$\delta$} and Q-P-V droops are proposed for HIC with automatic selective factors adjustment control. With the proposed control method, the HIC can effectively regulate active/reactive powers and improve power quality. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed structure and its control method, a 5-kW HIC is built, and results are presented for poor power quality situations. The results convincingly indicate that the proposed HIC is efficient and capable of low capacity advantage, multifunction control strategy, and overcapacity operation.},

An HDT-integrated active distribution network model is first established, and a Mixed-Integer SecondOrder Cone Programming (MISOCP) framework is developed to transform the non-convex optimization problem into a convex one through linearization and relaxation. Monte Carlo simulation is then used to capture uncertainties in renewable generation and load fluctuations.

However, the finite-control-set (FCS) type cannot fully satisfy high-quality requirements due to the variable switching frequency, and it is necessary to consider the continuous-control-set (CCS) type to achieve better control performances. Nevertheless, the use of conventional time series structures in CCS model-free predictive control algorithms poses a challenge due to the complex design of control laws. To address this issue, this article proposes a CCS model-free predictive control based on a time-series subspace, which is then applied to a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) driving system. This method constructs a time-series subspace model from data and creates a suitable control law using the recursive least squares algorithm and Lagrange method without any time-varying physical parameters, to predict the future behavior of the stator voltage. The stability of the proposed method is analyzed through Bode diagrams and zero/pole maps under different conditions.

  abstract = {Deadbeat predictive current control (DPCC) offers superiorities such as instant dynamic response and simple parameter tuning, but its high sensitivity to parameter mismatches severely degrades control performance in practical applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a simplified DPCC with robustness improvement (DPCC-RI) for open-winding permanent magnet synchronous motors (OWPMSMs) with common DC bus. Firstly, a real-time voltage reference vector distribution method is employed to suppress inherent zero-sequence current (ZSC) in OW-PMSMs by modulating zero-sequence voltage (ZSV) generated through active voltage vectors, thereby balancing the third-harmonic back electromotive force (EMF). Secondly, disturbances caused by parameter mismatches are compensated in the predictive model. Subsequently, a simplified robust controller is designed to compute disturbances based on the principle of cost function minimization, effectively reducing both the number of tuning parameters and system complexity. Finally, simulation results implemented in MATLAB/Simulink validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, there are still many challenging problems in the theory and applications of DRL, especially in learning control tasks with limited samples, sparse rewards, and multiple agents. Researchers have proposed various solutions and new theories to solve these problems and promote the development of DRL. In addition, deep learning has stimulated the further development of many subfields of reinforcement learning, such as hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), multiagent reinforcement learning, and imitation learning. This article gives a comprehensive overview of the fundamental theories, key algorithms, and primary research domains of DRL.

A well-known technique for implementing fast MPC is to compute the entire control law offline, in which case the online controller can be implemented as a lookup table. This method works well for systems with small state and input dimensions (say, no more than five), few constraints, and short time horizons. In this paper, we describe a collection of methods for improving the speed of MPC, using online optimization. These custom methods, which exploit the particular structure of the MPC problem, can compute the control action on the order of 100 times faster than a method that uses a generic optimizer. As an example, our method computes the control actions for a problem with 12 states, 3 controls, and horizon of 30 time steps (which entails solving a quadratic program with 450 variables and 1284 constraints) in around 5 ms, allowing MPC to be carried out at 200 Hz.},

The proposed secondary control scheme can remove the dc voltage deviation and improve the current sharing accuracy by using voltage-shifting and slope-adjusting approaches simultaneously. Meanwhile, the average value of droop coefficients is calculated, and then it is controlled by an additional controller included in the distributed secondary control layer to ensure that each droop coefficient converges at a reasonable value. Hence, by adjusting the droop coefficient, each participating converter has equal output impedance, and the accurate proportional load current sharing can be achieved with different line resistances. Furthermore, the current sharing performance in steady and transient states can be enhanced by using the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by detailed experimental tests based on a 3 \texttimes{} 1 kW prototype with three interface converters.},

In terms of FSBB's control strategies, the traditional single-mode strategy is low efficiency. While the two-mode strategy's control loop is relatively complicated. What's more, near the two modes' switching point, the converter will continuously switch between the Buck and Boost modes, which is not conducive to the stable operation of the system. So this paper proposes an improved single-mode control strategy. By fixing the switches' duty cycle of the Buck unit and controlling the duty cycle of the Boost unit, FSBB is enabled the function of buck-boost only in Boost mode. Also, an 80-160V input and 125-250V output prototype was built in the laboratory to verify the proposed strategy.},

Recognizing that some elements of the sampled data do not contribute to accurately depict the motion characteristics and operational states of the system, a frequency-converting double second-order generalized integrator (FC-DSOGI) structure is improved and utilized to extract these elements and reinject them by a random gain, thereby generating a coercive difference to reduce the stagnation effect. Furthermore, fuzzy logic is developed to determine the optimal gains for the control law, thereby enhancing the control performance. The generalized universal model (GUM) is chosen as an illustrative case. Through experimental validation, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with enhancements in current quality and model accuracy, alongside enhanced robustness.

To analyze the operating status and losses of an HDT, this study constructs a simplified equivalent impedance model for an HDT. First, the operating principle, characteristics, and voltage regulation range of a direct AC/AC HDT were analyzed. Second, based on the state--space averaging method, we obtain the HDT single-phase average circuit topology and construct an HDT relaxed two-port network model. Third, considering the operating losses of the transformer, Thevenin equivalent parameters of an HDT were derived. Then, a simplified equivalent impedance model for an HDT and the corresponding control strategies are presented. Finally, we verify the correctness and rationality of the proposed theory by constructing an HDT simulation model.},

Model predictive control (MPC) offers the advantage of convenient multiobjective optimization, quick response and a simple principle. However, once the parameter mismatch occurs due to some reasons (e.g., temperature change, noise from the sensors, etc.), the output performance of MPC system will be seriously deteriorated, sometimes may even endanger the system stability. Moreover, for cases when the circuit relation is unknown, the prediction model of the control object could not be established, rendering the traditional model-based MPC (TMPC) inapplicable. To address these challenges and enhance the robustness of the 3LT2C SAPF system, a linearly fitting sequential model free predictive control method is proposed. First, the principle of linear fitting method for current prediction is briefly analyzed. Second, a current difference matrix for each switch sequence has been established, which is utilized for harmonic current tracking.

The uniform control strategy unifies different control structures for multifunctional BIC in terms of power management, ac and dc voltage support. With the unified control structure, various triggering mechanisms for BIC mode-switch are not compulsory in response to the relevant scenario changes in the power network. Therefore, the negative consequences, such as unsmooth transition and system collapse due to the inaccurate or slower mode switch, can be avoided. Moreover, the uniform control strategy is also applicable for the hierarchical controlled hybrid microgrid, whose control architecture is typically comprised of the centralized and decentralized levels. This enables the communication fault ride-through capability and the impact from the communication failures can thus be mitigated. To sum up the above two features, the proposed control strategy is able to provide a smooth operation for the BIC without control mode switch in the event of unintentional scenario changes in power or communication network. To verify the validity of the proposed uniform control strategy, the controller hardware-in-the-loop experimental results have been provided in this paper.},

  abstract = {Hybrid AC/DC networks are an effective solution for future power systems, due to their ability to combine advantages of both AC and DC networks. However, they bring new technological challenges, one key area being the control of such a network. The network, and especially the interlinking converter (ILC), must be controlled to ensure that the DC and AC subsystems coordinate to stabilize the network and allocate power appropriately. This is an area which has attracted considerable recent interest due to the non-triviality of the control design. One promising tool is passivity theory which allows the derivation of decentralized conditions through which the stability of the network can be guaranteed. This paper investigates the application of a passivity framework to AC/DC grids, using a typical lossless line assumption. By ensuring that an appropriately formulated passivity condition is satisfied by the AC and DC buses, and the interlinking converter, the stability of the interconnection can be guaranteed. We also discuss how the ILC controller may be designed to achieve an appropriate power allocation between AC and DC sources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ILC control design regulates the frequency and voltages of the hybrid AC/DC network with a stable operation maintained.},

This hybrid structure utilizes FSBBs to regulate its output voltage by adjusting its duty cycle, handling a small portion of the total power, and providing a fast dynamic response. Meanwhile, the CLLC in the structure operates in a complete resonant state to ensure high system efficiency. By sharing a bridge arm between the FSBB and the CLLC, where one arm from each system serves a similar function, the number of switches utilized is significantly reduced, resulting in higher system efficiency. In addition to the structural improvements, to achieve a higher average system efficiency under different loads, this article presents an efficiency-based parameter design methodology. Furthermore, phase shift, an additional control freedom of FSBB, is employed to further enhance the system's overall efficiency; however, calculating the relationship between efficiency and phase shift can be burdensome, especially in real-time controllers. To address this issue, this article proposes a fitting-model-based maximum efficiency tracking approach to reduce calculation complexity. Ultimately, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design, highlighting its enhanced performance.},

Model-free predictive control (MFPC) has been widely applied in motor driving systems to resist the influences caused by unsuitable physical parameters. However, the seriously reduced current quality caused by phase current sensor faults has not been considered yet. To solve this problem, a low imbalance MFPC strategy is proposed in this paper, and applied to a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) under conditions of phase current sensor faults. A time-series model is built and online updated by the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm to describe the current operation state of the motor, and the imbalance degree caused by the current sensor fault is corrected by flat Tan-Sun (FTS) transform. Tested across various amplitudes and offsets, the effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed through experimental validations. The results highlight its superiority in reducing imbalance and enhancing current quality, compared with the model-based predictive control (MBPC) and conventional MFPC strategies without FTS transform.},

This approach replaces the a priori model with a data-driven model, eliminating the influence of physical parameters. However, the rotating coordinate system has various impacts on model accuracy, especially the inaccurate position signals and asymmetric controller that can cause errors. This article proposes a model-free predictive control strategy using a sinusoidal generalized universal model to directly control sinusoidal signals and improve model accuracy in reflecting the motion characteristics of the plant considering the past data. The model is designed based on signal variations from the plant, with online estimation of the coefficients using the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm to ensure model accuracy. To implement the control in a continuous-control-set (CCS) controller, the predictive signal is designed considering time-shift and Lagrange algorithms, and the basic performances and stability are analyzed in terms of pole/zero locations and differential equations. The proposed strategy is applied to a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) driving system as a predictive current control (PCC) strategy, and the experimental results under different operating conditions are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as well as its advantages in terms of model accuracy, current quality, and enhanced robustness compared to conventional control strategies.},

However, this type of topology is prone to present an unbalanced power distribution between the DC/DC power cells, mainly due to the natural differences between their components. This paper shows the application of a power balancing control strategy for interleaved partial power converters, which guarantees an equitable power distribution, therefore, it enables a correct sizing of the components.

However, this circuit will face the problem of operating mode switching when the input voltage is close to the output voltage. Considering this problem, the principles of the NIBB converter are analyzed in this article. The duty cycle combinations of an NIBB converter are analyzed, and an analysis method for the mode transition problem from a geometric perspective is proposed. Using the two-edge pulsewidth modulation method, a novel bumpless mode transition control method is proposed. A nonlinear feedforward controller with hysteresis is designed according to the state equation of the circuit. Moreover, the inductor current reference value is compensated when the mode is switched so that the mode transition problem of the NIBB circuit is effectively solved. In addition, a small-signal analysis of the proposed method is performed. The analysis shows that the proposed method has good stability and dynamic performance in various typical conditions. A 10-kW NIBB prototype is built in this article, and the corresponding experimental scenarios are designed. The experimental results show that compared with the results of unified PI control during the mode transition, the transient oscillation of the output voltage is smaller, and the duration of the transient process is shorter.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an active front-end converter for medium-voltage current-source drives. It comprises two series-connected pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) rectifiers fed from a delta-wye isolation transformer. These employ sequential-sampling synchronous space-vector modulation (SVM), and operate at a switching frequency of 100 Hz, thus reducing the switching losses by 66\% compared to previous PWM approaches. Digital processing requirements of this technique are minimized by using decision-making SVM. This online modulation technique ensures full harmonic current cancellation through the magnetic interface, and minimizes the sampling/control-action delay. Therefore it enables the use of advanced control strategies notwithstanding the low sampling frequency of the control system. Exploiting this fact, the proposed converter is controlled using a nonlinear strategy in the synchronous frame. The strategy employs input-output and feedback linearization, and is derived from the complex-signal flow diagram of the converter. The proposed strategy linearizes and partially decouples the converter d-q-axes dynamics, ensuring a dynamic response totally independent from the operating point, even under regeneration. This is a highly desirable feature for high-performance drives presenting continuous transitions from motoring to regeneration. Moreover, the converter presents an independent active and reactive power flow, which enables it to operate as a reactive power compensator if desired. Computer analysis and experimental work with a TMS320C32 digital-signal-processor-based 5-kVA laboratory prototype validate the excellent results attained by the proposed converter.},

However, the use of a coupling transformer (CT) for voltage compensation in HDTs leads to significant operational losses and costs. This paper presents a novel HDT utilizing dynamic topology reconfiguration of a multifunctional converter (MFC), enabling flexible voltage and current compensation. The proposed HDT's operating modes are examined through various switch configurations, facilitating MFC multiplexing. Additionally, a control strategy is introduced for seamless transitions between HDT modes, ensuring economical operation under stable grid conditions and safe operation during grid faults. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the HDT topology reconfiguration and control method.},

  abstract = {Energy sharing can activate prosumer flexibility to support power system operations. However, in practice, communication delays are inevitable and seriously threaten the real-time energy sharing equilibrium. While many asynchronous methods aim to address this, they ignore the learnability of prosumer's response and often struggle to balance convergence speed and stability. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel asynchronous algorithm based on best response (BR) learning. First, we demonstrate that the prosumer's best response in ADMM-based energy sharing can be represented as the piecewise linear function. Besides, we propose a batch-fitting method to learn the BR function with high accuracy and low computational cost. Building on this, we develop an asynchronous ADMM algorithm with a practical error criterion to ensure strict convergence of energy sharing under severe delays. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve faster convergence with fewer iterations and greater reliability across various energy sharing scales and asynchronous rates than existing asynchronous algorithms.},

  abstract = {Grid-tied voltage source inverters using LCL filter have been widely adopted in distributed power generation systems (DPGSs). As high-order LCL filters contain multiple resonant frequencies, switching harmonics generated by the inverter and current harmonics generated by the active/passive loads would cause the system resonance, and thus the output current distortion and oscillation. Such phenomenon is particularly critical when the power grid is weak with the unknown grid impedance. In order to stabilize the operation of the DPGS and improve the waveform of the injected currents, many innovative damping methods have been proposed. A comprehensive overview on those contributions and their classification on the inverter- and grid-side damping measures are presented. Based on the concept of the impedance-based stability analysis, all damping methods can ensure the system stability by modifying the effective output impedance of the inverter or the effective grid impedance. Classical damping methods for industrial applications will be analyzed and compared. Finally, the future trends of the impedance-based stability analysis, as well as some promising damping methods, will be discussed.},

Various high-frequency bridgeless boost rectifiers are harvested based on different types of interleaved boost converters, including the conventional boost converter and high step-up boost converters with voltage multiplier and coupled inductor. The full-bridge IBB converter with voltage multiplier is analyzed in detail. The voltage multiplier helps to enhance the voltage gain and reduce the voltage stresses of the semiconductors in the rectification circuit.

Moreover, optimized phase-shift modulation strategy is applied to the full-bridge IBB converter to achieve isolated buck and boost conversion.

In the isolated hybrid AC/DC microgrid (IHMG), the key problem is how to balance power variation and regulate voltage and frequency. Various energy storage systems (ESS) and interlinking converter (IC) technologies are viable for this application. The present study proposes a novel unified power flow (PF) model which can be applied to compare and analyze the practical operation modes of the IHMG and, further, to evaluate and compare the abilities of the ESS with different connection topologies and ICs with different control approaches to maintain the voltage and frequency stability of the IHMG. Five operation modes of the IHMG are defined and explained. Then, a set of generic PF equations are derived. Moreover, three binary matrices are applied as input parameters of the unified power equations. These matrices enable a single operation mode of the IHMG at a time to be constructed in the power equation. Finally, the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are verified against the time domain simulation result. The quasi-steady-state behaviors of multi-DC subgrids IHMG in different modes after a range of load fluctuation are investigated. The results show that the use of multiple grid-forming units in the AC and DC subgrids, when IC adopted normalized.},

And the DC bus voltage is sensitive to it. A virtual inertia control strategy of interlinking converters (ILCs) in an islanded hybrid microgrid is proposed in this paper, which restrains the DC bus voltage fluctuation and enhances the inertia of the hybrid microgrid. Traditional droop control methods of ILCs mostly only focus on power sharing. The proposed control strategy can not only maintain proportional power distribution between DC and AC subgrids, but also regulate the DC bus voltage directly. It can improve microgrid stability during DC-side loading transitions or distributed energy fluctuations. Moreover, no additional energy storage or inverters are required in a cost-effective manner. The validity of the proposed control method is verified by offline time-domain simulation in MATLAB/Simulink and real-time experiment in OPAL-RT digital platform.},

In order to reduce the number of power conversion stages and meet DC transmission demands under different DC voltage levels, this paper proposes a four-terminal interconnection scheme of the hybrid AC/DC microgrid, connecting one medium-voltage AC (MVAC) terminal, one medium-voltage DC (MVDC) terminal and two low-voltage DC (LVDC) terminals. The proposed interconnection scheme includes a modular multilevel converter (MMC) as the main interlinking converter of the MVAC grid and MVDC microgrid, and a series of dual active bridges (DAB) converters as two isolated LV DC microgrid interfaces. It has more flexibility for power supplies, especially MVDC transmission, and a more robust tolerance for unequal power distribution between the two LVDC Microgrids. To realize the DC capacitor voltage balancing control, an improved energy control method is proposed in this paper. The proposed method keeps DC capacitor voltage balance and AC current zero on the MVDC transmission lines, which contributes to the stability of the MVDC microgrid. In addition, the symmetry of the AC currents is also guaranteed with this control method. Validation results of a four-terminal hybrid AC/DC microgrid verify the effectiveness of the proposed microgrid and control scheme.},

To solve this issue, this paper proposes the novel modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based five-terminal MV/LV hybrid AC/DC microgrids. The proposed hybrid microgrids realize the interconnection between the medium-voltage AC (MVAC), MVDC, low voltage AC (LVAC), and two LVDC terminals. In addition, the MVAC grid is connected to the AC terminal of MMC, and the MVDC microgrid is connected to the DC terminal of MMC through a dual active bridge (DAB) converter. Based on MMC, the compact interlinking converters are established, providing three LVDC terminals, which are connected to two LVDC microgrids and one LVAC microgrid through a DC/AC converter. Compared with the conventional MMC-based hybrid microgrids, the proposed topology can significantly reduce the number of power switches. Moreover, to overcome the control challenge of arm energy balancing in MMC and meet the requirement of different operation modes in microgrids, a hierarchical energy control method is proposed, where the low circulating currents are injected to balance the arm energy. Therefore, the system operation capability can be improved under unbalanced power distribution. Validation results in different conditions (power step, power reversal, and unbalanced MVAC voltages) indicate that by the proposed method, the arm energy and capacitor voltages in MMC are well balanced, and the proposed hybrid AC/DC microgrids can operate normally at different modes.},

To solve this issue, this paper has proposed an uninterruptable hierarchical distributed coordinated control scheme of islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrid clusters. Firstly, when grid-forming converter faults occur in a certain AC microgrid (ACMG), the interlinking converter connected with the faulty subgrid switches its control mode into grid-forming, providing stable voltage and frequency support for the faulty ACMG. Then, a two-layer coordinated control scheme is presented, where the first layer is designed for the remaining interlinking converters, and the second layer is designed for converters in normal subgrids and grid-following converters in abnormal ACMG together with its interlinking converter. By the control mode switch of the IC and the two-layer coordinated control scheme, accurate power sharing can quickly fill the power deficit in the faulty subgrid, and the voltage and frequency of the microgrid clusters can remain stable. Verification results indicate that with the proposed scheme, the islanded AC/DC microgrid clusters can operate uninterruptedly under different kinds of grid-forming converter faults.},

Therefore, recognizing the inherent relationship and intrinsic differences between inverters and RSGs is essential for such target. By modeling the typical electromechanical transient of grid-tied PWM inverters, this paper first proves that PWM inverters and RSGs are similar in physical mechanism and equivalent in mathematical model, and the concept of static synchronous generator (SSG) is thereby developed. Furthermore, the comprehensive comparison between RSG and SSG is carried out in detail, and their inherent relation is built. Based on these findings, the rationality and feasibility of migrating the concepts, tools, and methods of RSG stability analysis to investigate the dynamic behaviors and stability issues of SSG is therefore confirmed. Taking stability issues as an example, the criteria of small signal and transient stability of a typical grid-tied PWM inverter is put forward to demonstrate the significance of the developed SSG model (including synchronizing coefficient, damping coefficient, inertia constant, and power-angle curve), providing clear physical interpretation on the dynamic characteristics and stability issues. The developed SSG model promotes grid-friendly integration of renewable energy to future grid and stimulates interdisciplinary research between power electronics and power system.},

Among them, the MV side relies on the traditional On-Line Tap Changer transformer (OLTC), and the LV side adopts the Hybrid Distribution Transformer (HDT), which is constructed based on the consideration of the different response characteristics of the two kinds of distribution equipment, and the integrated control strategy of voltage at different time scales under dual voltage levels is proposed. The dual voltage integrated control model is constructed based on the consideration of the different response characteristics of the two kinds of distribution equipment. Finally, under the MATLAB/Simulink environment, the simulation examples of medium- and low-voltage distribution networks are constructed, and the simulation results show that the voltage control strategy can effectively solve the voltage overrun problem of medium- and low-voltage users, and at the same time, it can reduce the total voltage deviation of the distribution network.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a hybrid transformer topology and its control method for active distribution networks. The hybrid distribution transformer consists of transformer windings and a back-to-back converter. The transformer windings are composed of a high-voltage winding, a low-voltage winding, and a control winding. The back-to-back power converter is formed by connecting two fully controlled SiC inverters in a back-to-back configuration. Its two AC ports are connected to the high-voltage and control windings through filtering inductors. When the hybrid transformer is used as a distribution transformer in an active distribution network, the low-voltage side can seamlessly switch between voltage-frequency control and active-reactive control strategies based on the comparison between the renewable penetration level and the renewable hosting capacity of the distribution network. This allows for constant voltage-frequency control when the renewable penetration level is low, and bidirectional power flow control when the renewable penetration level exceeds the hosting capacity, thus ensuring the safe integration of renewable generation systems and improving the power quality of active distribution networks.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the challenge of integrating Hybrid Distribution Transformers (HDTs) into the unbalanced Active Distribution Networks (ADNs). A two-stage robust VVC strategy is proposed to coordinate the operation of HDTs with a full spectrum of existing grid assets, including legacy devices such as on-load tap changers (OLTCs) and capacitor banks (CBs), and other flexible resources like Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and Demand Response (DR). The first stage determines a robust day-ahead schedule for slow-acting resources (OLTCs, CBs, ESS, DR), while the second stage performs real-time adjustments of HDTs to counteract uncertainties from PV generation and load demand. An accurate HDT power injection model, based on the auxiliary branch method, is developed to ensure modeling fidelity by incorporating internal impedance and series converter dynamics. The framework is built upon the coupled-phase second-order cone programming branch flow model (CP-SOCP-BFM) to accurately manage the network's three-phase unbalance. To solve the resulting large-scale, non-convex problem, a computationally efficient solution framework combining the Inexact Column-andConstraint Generation (i-CCG) algorithm and the Alternating Optimization Procedure (AOP) is proposed, which guarantees robust global optimality. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated on a modified IEEE 33-bus system. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate its superiority over deterministic, heuristic-based, and standard robust optimization methods in terms of both robustness and computational efficiency.},

The transfer-function-based active damping (TFAD) scheme is commonly adopted to mitigate the resonance problem but with cascaded control loops and high design complexity. On the contrary, multiobjective optimization can be easily realized in model predictive control (MPC) via a predefined cost function. As the coupling dynamic among state variables, a hybrid cost function, which contains the grid current, inverter-side current, and capacitor voltage tracking, is designed to guarantee system stability. The optimized control law is generated according to the minimization of the designed cost function, which is further transformed into the driving pulse by the modulator stage. In this process, the weighting factors are exactly arranged to place the desired closed-loop poles. The control law can ensure zero error tracking of grid current reference, which is better than the state feedback way. The hybrid cost function with modified reference is also proposed to reject the harmonics caused by the unhealthy grid condition. The control delay is compensated by using the forecast reference and the predictive state variable estimated from the observer. The proposed scheme performs the intuitive concept, reduced tuning complexity, and fast dynamic response. Simulated results and experiments are presented to verify the proposed control strategy.},

In this paper, a novel converter integrated Buck-Boost and DAB (IBBDAB) converter is proposed for superior performances under wide input voltage. The IBBDAB converter combines the advantages of the Four-Switch Buck-Boost (FSBB) converter and the DAB converter.

Moreover, an improved modulation strategy based on dual-edge PWM and single-phase-shift (DE-PWM- SPS) is applied to the IBBDAB converter. Combined with the modulation strategy, zero voltage switching (ZVS) can be easily achieved for all switches of DAB converter.

This article presents an overview of advanced control technologies for bidirectional dc/dc converters in dc microgrids. First, the stability issue caused by CPLs and the power balance issue caused by PPLs are discussed, which motivate the utilization of advanced control technologies for addressing these issues.

Then the applications of advanced control technologies in bidirectional dc/dc converters are presented for the stabilization of CPLs and accommodation of PPLs. Finally, advanced control techniques are explored in other high-gain nonisolated (e.g., interleaved, multilevel, cascaded) and isolated converters (e.g., dual active bridge) for high-power applications.},

The main purpose here is to find a suboptimal linear quadratic control taking explicitly into account the parametric uncertainties. The paper main contribution is threefold: 1) A descriptor system approach is used to show that the underlying singular linear-quadratic optimal control problem leads to a non-standard Riccati equation. 2) A solution to the proposed control problem is then given based on a connection to the so-called Lur'e matrix equations. 3) A synthesis method of multiple parametric SCLQ controllers is proposed to cover the whole parametric uncertainty while degrading as less as possible the intrinsic robustness properties of each local linear quadratic controller. Some examples are presented in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

Thanks to the adopted modeling approach, the control and modulation problems are formulated together as a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) problem. In doing so, not only the controller design process is greatly simplified, but also favorable performance in terms of controller bandwidth and robustness is achieved. This is in stark contrast to conventional linear control methods, where the existence of different cascaded and/or parallel control loops oftentimes leads to an adverse interaction with each other. Consequently, as also demonstrated by the presented experimental results, the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance for a wide range of operating conditions, rendering it as a promising control approach for the systems in question.},

Due to the existence of the resonant inductor (including the leakage inductor), the FB-boost converter can only adopt the two-edge-modulation (TEM) scheme with the FB cell being leading-edge modulated and the boost cell being trailing-edge modulated to minimize the inductor current ripple over the input-voltage range, and a phase-shift-control-scheme-based TEM with the use of the market available controller IC such as UC3895 is proposed, which realizes phase-shifted control for the FB cell to achieve zero-voltage switching. In order to improve the reliability and efficiency of the FB-boost converter, a three-mode dual-frequency control scheme is proposed, in which the FB-boost converter operates in boost, FB-boost and FB modes in low, medium and high input voltage regions, respectively, and for which the expression of the inductor current ripple is derived in this paper. As the input voltage in the FB-boost mode is close to the output voltage, the inductor current ripple in this mode is much smaller than that in the other modes, and the switching frequency of the boost cell in this mode can be lowered to one-(2N+1)th of the preset switching frequency to reduce the switching loss, and hence, to improve the efficiency. A 250-500 V input, 360 V output, and 6 kW rated power prototype is fabricated to verify the effectiveness of the design and control method. The average efficiency over the input-voltage range is 96.5\%, and the highest efficiency attained is 97.2\%.},

The proposed scheme is designed by combining the operating principles of traditional predictive control with the three-dimensional space vector modulation to enhance the output power quality, while producing fixed switching frequency operation and fast dynamic response for the four-leg inverter. In contrast to the classical predictive control which applies the switching state corresponding to optimal cost function, the proposed controller uses three active vectors and a zero vector to optimize the cost function. Finally, the switching states for four-leg inverter are produced by a modulation stage containing nine-segment switching pattern similar to the classical three-dimensional space vector modulation.

The proposed three-port converter (TPC) consists of a buck--boost converter, interposed between the battery storage system and the DC-AC inverter, in series with PV modules. The buck--boost converter in the proposed TPC is utilized for maximum power point tracking by regulating two power switches. The output power of the proposed converter is regulated by controlling the DC-AC converter. During the battery-charging mode, partial power regulation is employed with a direct power flow path (the series-connection of the PV panel, the battery and the output). As resistances in this path are almost negligible, the power conversion efficiency is higher than existing topologies. During battery-discharging mode, the power conversion is processed through a buck--boost converter with only two active power switches and one inductor. With fewer components, higher power conversion efficiency is also achieved. The circuit operation and analysis are presented in detail. To illustrate the simplicity of the converter control, the performance of the converter is tested with a straightforward maximum power point tracking on a PV system with battery cells. Simulation and experimental tests are carried out to demonstrate circuit operation and power conversion efficiency.},

  abstract = {Grid-forming inverters (GFI) play an important role as power interfaces for distributed generation units in islanded microgrids, where inductive-capacitive-inductive (LCL) output filters are commonly employed to mitigate the harmonics injected by voltage-source inverters. Due to advantages such as fast dynamic response and straightforward handling of constraints, Finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) has become an attractive option for voltage control in GFI systems. However, conventional FCS-MPC algorithms with short prediction horizon have performance limitations in the tracking of ac references in systems with high-order dynamics, such as LCL-filtered GFIs. On the other hand, predictive algorithms with extended prediction horizons suffer from an increased computational burden. This paper proposes a new FCS-MPC algorithm to accurately control the capacitor voltage in an LCL-filtered GFI, using a discrete-time prediction model to dynamically compute the reference for a FCS-MPC inverter-side current controller. The main advantages of the proposed method are its simple implementation without requiring the tuning of weighting factors in its cost function; and its short prediction horizon, which maintains a reduced computational cost. Moreover, active resonance damping elements such as digital filters or ad hoc feedback loops to deal with the LCL filter resonance are not required. Simulation tests and experimental results in a laboratory-scale setup confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm, yielding lower distortion of output voltage waveforms and increased robustness to modeling errors compared with the conventional FCS-MPC approach.},

A bidirectional droop control method for the converter is proposed, which measures the power demand degree of AC sub-grid and DC sub-grid according to AC bus frequency and DC bus voltage respectively, and determines the direction and magnitude of the converter transmission power. Two droop control modules, DC voltage-active power and AC frequency-active power, are included in the control structure. The power reference value of the converter is achieved from the output subtraction of two modules. Meanwhile to reduce the deviation of voltage and frequency caused by droop control, a recovery control is designed to improve the power quality and the reliability of the hybrid micro-grid. The bidirectional droop control can accurately coordinate the transmission power between AC subgrid and DC sub-grid and make full use of the distributed energy.

  abstract = {With the ever-increasing of population and economy worldwide, buildings have become major energy consumers and greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters. The hybrid AC/DC microgrid is a promising alternative for existing power distribution systems to achieve the goal of nearly/net zero energy buildings (nZEBs). However, the increasing demand for compact structure, seamless integration of distributed generators (DGs) and loads, as well as more control flexibility of hybrid microgrids cannot be adequately satisfied by conventional grid architectures. In view of this, an integrated and reconfigurable hybrid AC/DC microgrid architecture with its hierarchical control strategy is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a novel interlinking converter named smart interlinking unit (SIU) is presented, which can provide multiple AC/DC interfaces and diverse operation modes with various control functionalities. Secondly, the SIU-based hybrid microgrid architecture and its hierarchical control structure are established. The dedicated interfaces and cluster controllers for electric vehicles (EVs) facilitate the implementation of centralized vehicle-to-grid (V2G) service. Thirdly, a hierarchical control strategy of SIU, which involves local control in primary control level and power flow control in secondary control level, is introduced to realize coordinated operation of microgrid. The model of the proposed hybrid microgrid architecture is built, and the simulation results demonstrate that the microgrid architecture and hierarchical control strategy can achieve a reliable and coordinated system operation under various kinds of scenarios. Additionally, the mutual power support between AC and DC sub-grids is realized with increased utilization and local consumption of renewable energy resources (RESs).},

Facilitating flexible configurations, grid networking and coordinated operation among multiple microgrids are essential for the microgrid cluster. In view of this, this paper presents a scalable and reconfigurable hybrid microgrid clustering architecture and a corresponding decentralized control method. Initially, a new interlinking converter referred as energy networking unit (ENU) is proposed. The ENU is used to interface the AC and DC subgrid in single hybrid microgrid, and also facilitates the connection with the external power grid. Then the ENU-based hybrid microgrid clustering architecture is established, which is characterized by scalability, reconfigurability and modularity. Thanks to the reconfigurable topology of ENUs, the architecture could realize flexible AC/DC interconnection between microgrids by the same converter modules with less power conversion units. Finally, a proposed decentralized control strategy for this architecture could realize autonomous power exchange between subgrids in single microgrid with considering energy storage restrictions and smooth mode switch. And an adaptive and autonomous power interaction among neighboring microgrids is also achieved with full utilization of the compensation capacity of clusters, thus improving the system reliability, as well as the utilization and local consumption of RESs. The effectiveness of the proposed clustering architecture and decentralized control strategy is verified by comprehensive cases.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of distributed generation promotes active distribution networks (ADNs) while challenging power quality management. The topologically re-construable hybrid distribution transformer (ReC-HDT), capable of compensating for voltage sags, suppressing harmonics, and eliminating imbalances, has garnered considerable attention. However, although the voltage sag compensation capability of ReC-HDT is superior to conventional HDTs, it remains constrained by capacity limitations. This constraint may cause insufficient compensation for downstream sensitive loads in critical scenarios. Since voltage sags are sporadic quality issues, simply increasing converter capacity to address these demands would incur substantial costs. Therefore, to address this without capacity upgrades, interconnecting two ReC-HDTs via DC links is proposed to expand the compensation range. However, multiple operational modes introduced by interconnection complicate control coordination. This paper analyzes the structure of a dual-station-area interconnected system, detailing the topology reconstruction method and the operational mechanisms of the ReC-HDT. On this basis, four interconnection modes and their compensable voltage sag ranges are derived. Furthermore, a multi-mode coordinated control strategy for the interconnected system is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated through digital simulations on the PLECS platform and hardware-in-loop experiments.},

  abstract = {Two-stage photovoltaic (PV) configurations have become increasingly popular due to the decoupling between the inverter dc-link voltage and the PV voltage, adding flexibility to extend the maximum power point tracking range. However, the additional dc-dc converter increases the power converter losses. The concept of partial power converters (PPCs), which reduce the amount of power handled by the dc stage, can mitigate this effect. However, the type of topology, its power and voltage rating, efficiency, and an operating range can vary significantly depending on the function (boosting or reducing voltage) and type of PV application and scale (micro-, string-, or multi-sting inverter). This paper analyzes the possible configuration of connections of PPC depending on the application and scale of the PV system and introduces a new buck-type PPC. Three solutions for practical PV systems are further elaborated, including experimental validation. Results show that the PPC concept greatly improves the overall PV system efficiency with the added benefit that the dc-dc stage power ratings achieved are only a fraction of the PV system, reducing size and cost of the power converter without affecting the system performance.},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems composed by two energy conversion stages are attractive from an operation point of view. This is because the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) range is extended, due to the voltage decoupling between the PV system and the dc-link. Nevertheless, the additional dc-dc conversion stage increases the volume, cost and power converter losses. Therefore, central inverters based on a single-stage converter, have been a mainstream solution to interface large-scale PV arrays composed of several strings connected in parallel made by the series connections of PV modules. The concept of partial power converters (PPC), previously reported as a voltage step-up stage, has not addressed in depth for all types of PV applications. In this work, a PPC performing voltage step-down operation is proposed and analyzed. This concept is interesting from the industry point of view, since with the new isolation standards of PV modules are reaching 1500 V, increasing both the size of the string and dc-link voltage for single-stage inverters. Since grid connection remains typically at 690 V, larger strings impose more demanding operation for single-stage central inverters (required to operate at lower modulation indexes and demand higher blocking voltage devices), making the proposed step-down PPC an attractive solution. Theoretical analysis and an experimental test-bench was built in order to validate the PPC concept, the control performance and the improvement of the conversion efficiency. The experimental results corroborate the benefits of using a PPC, in terms of increasing the system efficiency by reducing the processed power of the converter, while not affecting the system performance.},

Despite the benefits micro-grid operation can bring to the power system, many challenges and technical issues constraint its operation. This paper addresses two main challenges associated with the operation of micro-grids: voltage/frequency control and protection. The main aim of this paper is three-fold. First, a control strategy for inverter based DGs is proposed to control both voltage and frequency during islanded operation. Secondly, a protection scheme is proposed to protect both the lines and DGs during islanded operation. Lastly, both the control scheme and the protection scheme are coordinated to avoid nuisance tripping of the DGs and non-critical loads. The study is performed using a digital computer simulation approach PSCAD/EMTDC.},

The proposed method is based on equipping the DG interface with a Q-f droop curve that forces the DG to lose its stable operation once an islanding condition occurs. A simple passive islanding detection scheme that relies on frequency relays can then be used to detect the moment of islanding. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated under the IEEE 1547 and UL 1741 antiislanding test configuration. The studies reported in this paper are based on time-domain simulations in the power systems computer-aided design (PSCAD)/EMTDC environment. The results show that the proposed technique has negligible nondetection zone and is capable of accurately detecting islanding within the standard permissible detection times. In addition, the technique proves to be robust under multiple-DG operation.},

  abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) has gained significant traction in the control of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives due to its fast response and ability to handle system constraints. However, conventional predictive direct speed control (PDSC) methods rely on weighting factors, which require complex tuning and increase computational burden. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a direct voltage selection (DVS)-based PDSC scheme that eliminates the need for weighting factors while significantly improving computational efficiency. The method further enhances performance by incorporating virtual voltage vectors (VVVs), expanding the number of selectable voltage vectors from seven to 19, thereby reducing current harmonics and torque ripples. To mitigate the additional computational complexity introduced by VVVs, a voltage vector preselection (VVP) strategy is implemented, ensuring real-time feasibility. The results of the comparative simulation demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional PDSC methods, achieving superior speed regulation, reduced ripple effects, and enhanced dynamic response under various operating conditions. This control strategy is particularly well suited for real-time applications in embedded and low-cost systems, where computational efficiency and high performance are critical.},

The grid-forming generator produces a reference voltage with a constant frequency of 50Hz while both the grid-supporting and grid-feeding generators take the voltage as reference at their respective coupling points with the microgrid. Both the grid-forming and grid-supporting generators produce output real power based on their respective terminal voltage deviation from the rated voltage. The grid-feeding generator outputs a planned real power. To manage the reactive power demand by the loads, reactive power output from each of the three types of generators needs be coordinated. In order to ensure accurate tracing of the reference of real power output from each of the grid-forming, grid-supporting and grid-feeding generators, the reactive power from each of them needs be kept within a fraction of its real power output. Such a fraction has been determined numerically by using a grid-tied inverter. The proposed method for operating the AC microgrid was validated using the real-time fixed time-step simulation in Matlab/Simulink platform.},

The results reveal that when the control mode of an interlinking converter changes from P/Q control to AC voltage control, the system minor-loop gain utilized to assess the AC-side stability evolves to its inverse matrix. In contrast, the stability assessment related to the DC side (and the coupling interaction between the AC and DC sides) remains unchanged. Furthermore, the DC- and AC-side stabilities can also be regulated independently and are dominated by the d-axis and the q-axis controllers, respectively.},

In order to increase the service life and reliability of hybrid distribution transformers, this paper proposes a remote management system using LoRa technology based on fuzzy logic. HDT based on a fuzzy logic judgment system (FLJS) replaces the Boolean logic with fuzzy logic and several power quality problems including power factors, load-side current harmonics and voltage unbalance are considered, as well as grid-side voltage deviation and unbalance. This management system can dynamically adjust the working states of HDT according to the output results of the FLJS to reduce the use time of power electronic devices. Due to the application of LoRa, this management system can remotely adjust the parameters of the FLJS in real time for different distribution network nodes to avoid frequent switching of HDT working states. In addition, it is able to remotely monitor the real-time working states and fault states of HDT to reduce recovery time and maintenance costs in case of HDT failure. Finally, simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed management system for HDT.},

Frequency and voltage deviations beyond the acceptable threshold can lead to unscheduled load curtailments, cascading failures, or even power system blackouts. To enhance the stability of hybrid ac/dc microgrids, this article proposes a hybrid microgrid with bidirectional virtual inertia support, where virtual inertia is introduced to slow down dc voltage and ac frequency changes, thus enhancing the system stability. The proposed approach allows significant reductions in voltage and frequency fluctuations. With a standard hybrid microgrid configuration, inertia is delivered to both ac and dc subgrids via the change of bidirectional interlinking converter control. Specifically, the bidirectional interlinking converter uses the dc voltage of the dc grid and ac frequency of the ac grid as inputs through a proportional-integral (PI) controller and regulates the active power between two subgrids so that inertia and other supportive functions are implemented. To validate the merits of the proposed approach, experimental results are provided. According to experimental results, the frequency nadir, rate-of-change-of-frequency, and dc bus voltage deviation can be improved by the proposed strategy of bidirectional virtual inertia support in the hybrid ac/dc microgrid.},

This approach allows the controller to derive the optimal control law by utilizing only historical input and output data, enhancing the robustness of the system to parameter variations.

  abstract = {Partially rated dc interlinking converters are recognized for their high-gain power regulation capabilities, which effectively synergize active power across dc microgrids (DCMGs). Integrating energy storage units (ESUs) to address the intermittent nature of renewables in DCMGs has become an enhanced requirement for these converters. This article proposes a partially rated multiport interlinking converter (PMIC) that incorporates a distributed ESU. The PMIC controls a floating voltage and a bidirectional shunt current on the dc line, ensuring full galvanic isolation for the ESU while operating at a low dc-link voltage. It regulates multidirectional power flow and balances power during peak and off-peak periods. A decentralized droop-based power flow control strategy is proposed for the PMIC, which distributes renewable energy generation, load consumption, and ESU utilization proportionally across the system. The control strategy includes two tailored continuously differentiable activation functions, Sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent, to facilitate autonomous global power-sharing and seamless ESU engagement. Simulation and experimental case studies confirm the PMIC's capability to smooth renewable energy fluctuations and enhance the power and voltage profiles of DCMGs.},

  abstract = {Path planning and tracking control are essential parts of autonomous vehicle research. Regarding path planning, the Rapid Exploration Random Tree Star (RRT*) algorithm has attracted much attention due to its completeness. However, the algorithm still suffers from slow convergence and high randomness. Regarding path tracking, the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) algorithm is widely used in various control applications due to its efficient stability and ease of implementation. However, the relatively empirical selection of its weight matrix can affect the control effect. This study suggests a path planning and tracking control framework for autonomous vehicles based on an upgraded RRT* and Particle Swarm Optimization Linear Quadratic Regulator (PSO-LQR) to address the abovementioned issues. Firstly, according to the driving characteristics of autonomous vehicles, a variable sampling area is used to limit the generation of random sampling points, significantly reducing the number of iterations. At the same time, an improved Artificial Potential Field (APF) method was introduced into the RRT* algorithm, which improved the convergence speed of the algorithm. Utilizing path pruning based on the maximum steering angle constraint of the vehicle and the cubic B-spline algorithm to achieve path optimization, a continuous curvature path that conforms to the precise tracking of the vehicle was obtained. In addition, optimizing the weight matrix of LQR using POS improved path-tracking accuracy. Finally, this article's improved RRT* algorithm was simulated and compared with the RRT*, target bias RRT*, and P-RRT*. At the same time, on the Simulink--Carsim joint simulation platform, the PSO-LQR is used to track the planned path at different vehicle speeds. The results show that the improved RRT* algorithm optimizes the path search speed by 34.40\% and the iteration number by 33.97\%, respectively, and the generated paths are curvature continuous. The tracking accuracy of the PSO-LQR was improved by about 59\% compared to LQR, and its stability was higher. The position error and heading error were controlled within 0.06 m and 0.05 rad, respectively, verifying the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed path planning and tracking control framework.},

  abstract = {This paper is mainly focused on the stability-related issues of a grid-tied interlinking converter system. First, hybrid AC/DC admittance characteristics of an interlinking converter operating under unity and non-unity power factors are analyzed separately. Then, by using the hybrid AC/DC admittance and determinant-based General Nyquist Criterion (GNC), the stability assessment, instability root cause identification, and instability mitigation of a grid-tied interlinking converter system are studied. In addition, decoupled mitigation of the AC- and DC-side instabilities are discussed based on the hybrid AC/DC admittance characteristics. The study results show that when an interlinking converter operates under unity power factor, the stabilities of the AC and DC sides are decoupled and can be regulated independently. To be more specific, the DC-side stability is subjected to the d-axis admittance, DC admittance, and their coupling admittances while the AC-side stability is dominated by the q-axis admittance. According to the hybrid AC/DC admittance characteristics, this paper further reveals that the DC-side stability is determined by the d-axis controllers. In contrast, the AC-side stability is governed by the q-axis controllers and the phase-locked loop (PLL). Finally, the analysis presented in this paper is verified based on frequencyand time-domain simulations in the Matlab/Simulink environment.},

In this paper, we take an initial step towards bridging this gap by proposing the data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO) method, which requires only a finite number of sufficiently exciting data to iteratively solve the LQR problem via PO. Based on a data-driven closed-loop parameterization, we are able to directly compute the policy gradient from a batch of persistently exciting data. Next, we show that the nonconvex PO problem satisfies a projected gradient dominance property by relating it to an equivalent convex program, leading to the global convergence of DeePO. Moreover, we apply regularization methods to enhance the certainty-equivalence and robustness of the resulting controller and show an implicit regularization property. Finally, we perform simulations to validate our results.},

In this paper, we propose a direct adaptive method to learn the LQR from online closed-loop data. First, we propose a new policy parameterization based on the sample covariance to formulate a direct data-driven LQR problem, which is shown to be equivalent to the certainty-equivalence LQR with optimal non-asymptotic guarantees. Second, we design a novel data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO) method to directly update the policy, where the gradient is explicitly computed using only a batch of persistently exciting (PE) data. Third, we establish its global convergence via a projected gradient dominance property. Importantly, we efficiently use DeePO to adaptively learn the LQR by performing only one-step projected gradient descent per sample of the closed-loop system, which also leads to an explicit recursive update of the policy. Under PE inputs and for bounded noise, we show that the average regret of the LQR cost is upper-bounded by two terms signifying a sublinear decrease in time \textbackslash mathcal O(1/\textbackslash sqrtT) plus a bias scaling inversely with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which are independent of the noise statistics. Finally, we perform simulations to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the computational and sample efficiency of our method.},

In this article, a unified impedance model, suitable for either inverter current control (ICC) or grid current control (GCC) of LCL-type grid-connected inverters with observer-based capacitor current feedback active damping, is built to facilitate the passivity-based stability assessment and controller parameter design. With the passivity analysis, it is found that when the antiresonant frequency of LCL filter is in certain ranges, i.e., (0.056\o mega \_s, 0.20\o mega \_s) for ICC and (0.046\o mega \_s, 0.23\o mega \_s) for GCC, all frequencies' passive output admittance of the inverter can be achieved via proposed parameter design guidelines. Due to the utilization of the observer and all frequencies' passive output admittance property, not only extra current sensors for active damping can be saved, but also the inverter can be connected and stably operated in a grid regardless of the grid impedance. The validity of the theoretical analysis and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by using experimental results on a laboratory prototype.},

A growing trend is direct LQR design, which finds the optimal LQR gain directly from raw data and bypassing system identification. To achieve this, our previous work develops a direct LQR formulation parameterized by sample covariance. In this letter, we propose a regularization method for the covariance-parameterized LQR. We show that the regularizer accounts for the uncertainty in both the steady-state covariance matrix corresponding to closed-loop stability, and the LQR cost function corresponding to averaged control performance. With a positive or negative coefficient, the regularizer can be interpreted as promoting either exploitation or exploration, which are well-known trade-offs in reinforcement learning. In simulations, we observe that our covariance-parameterized LQR with regularization can significantly outperform the certainty-equivalence LQR in terms of both the optimality gap and the robust stability.},

  abstract = {Configuring an output inductive-capacitive (LC) filter for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives can mitigate the overvoltage issues in long-distance transmission applications. However, the resulting LC-filtered PMSM system may cause an undesired resonance phenomenon, threatening the system's stability. This article proposes a modulated predictive stator current control scheme with capacitor-voltage-feedforward active damping (MPSCC-CVF) to stabilize the LC-filtered PMSM drives. First, a recursion-based stator-current predictive model is established, reducing the computational complexity. Then, a modulated predictive stator current controller with a fixed switching frequency is proposed, which can achieve low current ripples and harmonics. To address the resonance issues, a capacitor-voltage-feedforward active damping (CVF) strategy is integrated into the proposed modulated predictive stator current control (MPSCC). Furthermore, the closed-loop stability analysis and parameter tuning are provided in theory. Experimental results validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.},

The inverters which are operated in this way are called static synchronous generators (SSG). This means that the well-established theory/device for synchronous generators can still be used for inverters, which will dominate the power generation in the future because of the increasing share of distributed generation sources and renewable energy sources utilised. The power of an SSG can be regulated using the well-known frequency and voltage drooping mechanism. SSGs can also be easily operated in grid-connected mode or island mode. Simulation results are given to verify the idea.},

  abstract = {Distribution transformers play a pivotal role as an isolation stage between varying voltage levels. However, with the increasing demands of distribution generations, the conventional low-frequency transformer (LFT) faces challenges in maintaining qualified voltage levels. In response, a hybrid distribution transformer (HDT), integrating an LFT and a power converter, emerges as an optimal solution. One crucial concern when employing a converter is the magnetizing inrush current of LFT. In this paper, an HDT topology without auxiliary transformer winding is proposed in a single phase, featuring a converter connected in series on the primary side and a converter connected in parallel on the secondary side. This configuration provides adjustment capability to address voltage irregularities. This paper delves into the working principle for the HDT, with a specific focus on the magnetizing inrush current considering line voltage variation. Further, the control strategies for line voltage regulation and magnetizing inrush current suppression are proposed. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, emphasizing its potential to enhance voltage control in distribution transformers.},

Firstly, the mathematical model of the FLDIPs is given to analyse the stability of the system. Then, the PSO algorithm is improved from the perspective of dynamically adjusting inertia weights to optimize linear quadratic regulator (LQR) parameters. Finally, through simulation comparison with the LQR control effect obtained by the manual trial and error method, the feasibility of the improved PSO algorithm is verified. This method can not only improve the control performance of the system but also effectively overcome the problem of blindness in selecting Q for traditional LQR optimal control.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an analytical methodology to evaluate the power processed by dc-dc converters operating as series voltage regulators, which provide an alternative to increase efficiency in photovoltaic systems. Via the analysis of both active and nonactive power processing, the proposed methodology allows to clearly distinguish among circuit topologies as truly partial-power processing (PPP) or just partial active power processing topologies. When an isolated dc-dc topology is connected in series as a voltage regulator, the overall processed power can be reduced, which reduces power losses and improves efficiency. Conversely, this paper also demonstrates that some series-regulator topologies may not actually reduce the proportion of nonactive processed power. To demonstrate the applications of the proposed methodology and to emphasize its significance, two well-known series-connected voltage regulators (flyback and full-bridge phase shift) and a full-power regulator (boost) were evaluated. The results indicate that the full-bridge series regulator can perform a true PPP, whereas the flyback series-regulator processes the same amount of power as that processed by conventional nonisolated boost converters and cannot be considered a partial-power topology. This study finding contradicts assertions in the literature that this topology achieves high-efficiency dc-dc conversion through PPP. To confirm the theoretical analysis, experimental results from three 750-W prototypes are presented alongside its simulations.},

A design procedure based on the definition of the voltage regulation range is presented. It introduces an additional degree of freedom that allows a proper design of the converter in order to reduce not only the active power but also the nonactive power, reducing losses and increasing power density. By means of the proposed approach, it is also demonstrated that by replacing the conventional step-up partial-power converter by a step-up/down partial-power converter, the active and nonactive power can be further reduced, allowing to better explore the benefits of the partial-power concept. In order to validate the proposed approach, two 750-W prototypes of full-bridge S-PPC and full-bridge/push-pull S-PPC were implemented and experimentally evaluated. The step-up/down prototype presented a reduction of 46.9\% in nonactive power and 23.4\% of its volume, resulting in a higher efficiency and power density in comparison to the voltage step-up prototype counterpart.},

The studied grid-connected HMG contains one dc and one ac microgrid, interconnected by BILPCs. To consider uncertainties, the nonlinear uncertain model of the BILPC is derived and linearized based on Lie derivative concept. As a new point of view for dynamic modeling of BILPC, it is indicated that each nonlinear uncertain BILPC model can be represented by two decoupled subsystems. Then, a virtual robust state feedback controller is designed to independently control each of these subsystems with disturbance rejection capability. The gains of the state feedback controllers are obtained using Ackerman pole placement method. To approximate the unknown inputs/unmodeled dynamics, which are needed in the design process of the state feedback controllers, a high-gain proportional-integral (PI) observer is designed. The high gains of this PI observer are determined using linear quadratic regulation method. Simulation results and comparative studies support the efficacy of the proposed control approach.},

Battery energy storage systems (BESSs), which can adjust their power output at much steeper ramping than conventional generation, are promising assets to restore suitable frequency regulation capacity levels. BESSs are typically connected to the grid with a power converter, which can be operated in either grid-forming or grid-following modes. This paper quantitatively assesses the impact of large-scale BESSs on the frequency containment of low inertia power grid and compares the performance of grid-forming and grid-following control modes. Numerical results are provided considering a detailed dynamic model of the IEEE 39-bus system where fully characterized models of stochastic demand and generation are taken into account. In order to assess the performance of the BESS control modes in a practical operative context, daily long simulations are considered where reserve levels for frequency containment and restoration are allocated considering the current practice of a transmission system operator in Europe. Numerical analyses on various metrics applied to grid frequency show that grid-forming outperforms grid-following converter control mode.},
