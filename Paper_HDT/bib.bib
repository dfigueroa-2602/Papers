  abstract = {PV systems are penetrating the energy generation market rapidly and their output strongly depends on environmental conditions. To maximize the energy yield, the utilization of power electronic converters with maximum power tracking function is mandatory. Typically, the dc voltage generated by PV is fed into the ac grid using an dc-ac inverter. On the other hand, most modern loads, from small to large ones, are based on dc. Hence, wide adoption of residential dc microgrids (RDC {\textbackslash}mu Gs) based on PV energy generation becomes a trend that is following the developments in modern energy-efficient buildings. This paper targets power converters for the integration of PV systems into RDC {\textbackslash}mu Gs. It considers two main classes: high step-up converters for PV module-level (parallel optimizer) applications and non-isolated buck-boost converters for the PV string (series optimizer) applications. Due to the importance of the PV topic, a significant number of topologies have been introduced in the literature. However, only selected solutions attracted the interest of the industry. This review paper considers PV converters used in the industry or demonstrated in academic publications at a high technology readiness level with comprehensive experimental justification. This allows us to focus this review on the most valuable solutions and to provide a guide for both industry and academic readers. In the end, future trends in industrial PV systems and associated power converters are discussed.},

  abstract = {The converter efficiency defines the overall efficiency of a renewable energy system. In a full power converter, its components process the whole input power, even if it is not mandatory. Partial power processing (PPP) is an exciting concept for improving overall system efficiency and reducing system cost and size. In PPP, the converter processes the amount of power needed to be processed. This work proposes a PPP based on the high-performance Quasi-Z-Source Series Resonance converter (QZSSRC). The proposed partial power converter has a series-input parallel-output (SIPO) architecture. Previous publications in this area mainly consider converters with step-down voltage regulation, like the phase-shifted full-bridge converter. They underperform in this application due to operating at the maximum power when bucking the voltage the most. This paper studies two other types of dc-dc converters, buck-boost and boost, in SIPO partial power converters. Theoretical operation principles are corroborated with full experimental results given and analyzed. A 300 W prototype of the QZSSRC is used to convert the power of up to 2 kW in a PPP system with overall system efficiency over 99\%.},

Processing a percentage of the total power, instead of processing the full power, improves system efficiency and reduces system cost and size. In this paper, an input parallel output series (PISO) buck-boost partial power converter is presented. The first stage of the system is controlled to ensure that PV panels are operating at the maximum power (MP). And the second resonant stage is controlled to fix the dc-bus voltage. Although the system has five-switches, four of them are operating in zero voltage and current switching, to eliminate switching losses of the system. Converter sharing percentage is adjusted to ensure optimum operation of the complete PV system. System analysis and simulation are demonstrated through the manuscript. Experimental and more comparative analysis will be presented in the final version.},

Two continuous control set MPC (CCS-MPC) formulations are considered: the classical current tracking delta MPC (Del-MPC) and the torque tracking economic MPC (EMPC). To achieve offset-free torque tracking under model uncertainties and in all regions of operation, a disturbance observer and a dq-current reference generator are used. To enable real-time implementation of the long-horizon CCS-MPC, the development of a real-time capable solver is not required, since MPC approximation based on deep neural networks (DNNs) is considered and utilized for controller's evaluation at run time. The approximation is done by training the DNN to learn the MPC functionality based on offline-generated training data and in an open-loop manner. The robust and offset-free tracking performance of the proposed DNN-based approximate long-horizon Del-MPC and EMPC has been validated through simulation and real-time implementation at test bench and compared to the state-of-the-art field oriented control (FOC) using internal model controller with field-weakening (FW) part and to the exact short-horizon MPC based on the fast gradient method (FGM-MPC). Results show that the long-horizon MPC can achieve significantly faster torque transient responses in comparison with the short-horizon FGM-MPC and the conventional FOC, especially in FW region.},

The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has proven its superiority over many meta-heuristic algorithms for solving the multi-objective optimization problem.

The hierarchical control strategy, consisting of primary and secondary control, is used to regulate HMG. Primary control utilizes droop control for power sharing on AC and DC buses, while secondary control restores AC frequency and DC/AC bus voltages. The ILCs are controlled using hybrid and inverse Q -V droop with low-pass filters (LPFs) to mitigate high-frequency noise, ensuring efficient power exchange between AC and DC sections. The literature review reveals the need for the model development and testing of the parallel-operated ILC in HMG consisting of primary and secondary control. Hence, a linearized small-signal model consisting of primary and secondary control for HMG has been proposed. The model incorporates AC, DC, and ILC dynamics to analyze the power flow and stability of the system. An eigenvalue analysis is performed to assess the impact of the droop coefficients, providing insight into stability enhancement. Time-domain simulations evaluate transient behaviors under disturbances, and the controller hardware-in-loop (CHIL) platform is used to validate the dynamic response. The findings demonstrate the stability of HMG and the critical role of ILCs in enabling power transfer, akin to inter-area tie-lines in conventional systems},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comparative study of two predictive speed control schemes for induction machine (IM) in terms of their design and performance. The first control scheme is finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC) with modulation control and the second control scheme is continuous control set-model predictive control (CCS-MPC) with space vector-pulse width modulation. The two schemes adopt the cascaded control approach, which consists of an inner MPC loop for torque control and outer MPC loop for speed control using two individual cost functions. The outer MPC produces the required torque to drive the IM at the reference speed while the reference torque is taken as the input of the inner MPC, which in turn generates control signals for the inverter. The control states of the two MPCs are constrained with the maximum limits of the drive system. The state feedback is achieved with a standard Kalman filter, which estimates the nonmeasured load torque. For a fair comparison, both approaches are applied to the same IM at the same operational circumstances. The control approaches are implemented and validated in an experimental environment using the same sampling frequency on the same test bench (3.7 kW IM drive). The behavior of the control approaches is assessed by applying reference and disturbance steps to the system in different operational modes. Comparison of the predictive schemes leads to the conclusion that the both MPC approaches achieve similar performances. However, the CCS-MPC scheme has a smaller current ripple and is of low computational complexity. The computing duration is not very different for the three tested schemes. CCS-MPC can cope with a less powerful DSP than for FCS.},

  abstract = {Self-governing small regions of power systems, known as ``microgrids'', are enabling the integration of small-scale renewable energy sources (RESs) while improving the reliability and energy efficiency of the electricity network. Microgrids can be primarily classified into three types based on their voltage characteristics and system architecture; 1) AC microgrids, 2) DC microgrids, and 3) Hybrid AC/DC microgrids. This paper presents a comprehensive review of stability, control, power management and fault ride-through (FRT) strategies for the AC, DC, and hybrid AC/DC microgrids. This paper also classifies microgrids in terms of their intended application and summarises the operation requirements stipulated in standards (e.g., IEEE Std. 1547-2018). The control strategies for each microgrid architecture are reviewed in terms of their operating principle and performance. In terms of the hybrid AC/DC microgrids, specific control aspects, such as mode transition and coordinated control between multiple interlinking converters (ILCs) and energy storage system (ESS) are analysed. A case study is also presented on the dynamic performance of a hybrid AC/DC microgrid under different control strategies and dynamic loads. Hybrid AC/DC microgrids shown to have more advantages in terms of economy and efficiency compared with the other microgrid architectures. This review shows that hierarchical control schemes, such as primary, secondary, and tertiary control are very popular among all three microgrid types. It is shown that the hybrid AC/DC microgrids require more complex control strategies for power management and control compared to AC or DC microgrids due to their dependency on the ILC controls and the operation mode of the hybrid AC/DC microgrid. Case study illustrated the significant effects of microgrid feeder characteristics on the dynamic performance of the hybrid AC/DC microgrid. It is also revealed that any transient conditions either in the AC or DC microgrids could propagate through the ILC affecting the entire microgrid dynamic performance. Additionally, the critical control issues and the future research challenges of microgrids are also discussed in this paper.},

The aim is to regulate the output voltage of a Distributed Energy Resource (DER) LC filter to achieve its behavior as a controlled oscillator while complying with the converter's physical limitations. The MPC makes it possible to impose constraints on the state and the input, but at a relatively high computational cost compared with other control methods. Nevertheless, the restrictions applied to the converter modulated voltage and the converter current allow for improving the control performance while achieving a safe response to contingencies. The two alternative solvers, namely Quadprog and Operator splitting solver for quadratic programs (OSQP), are evaluated through simulations to identify efficient alternatives for future real-time embedded implementations. Additionally, a state observer that estimates the DER's output current and input disturbances is included in the control to achieve reference tracking. The electrical simulation software used is PLECS integrated with Matlab/Simulink for implementation of the control. This simulation test bench is used to tune the control parameters, including the horizon, and estimate the potential gain in numerical efficiency achievable using OSQP in embedded control of the application of interest.},

To mitigate partial shading effects, distributed maximum power point tracking (DMPPT) architectures have been proposed. An emerging DMPPT technique represented by PV module cascaded converters (MCCs) has been widely reported in the literature. In this architecture, a DC converter is allocated for each PV module to process and maximise its power. In this sense, mismatch effects are mitigated between PV modules. While MCC architecture has prominent advantages and value-added features, its challenges and limitations cannot be ignored. This study presents a comprehensive review of the state of the art of PV MCC architecture to help readers realise the progress of this DMPPT technique. Several points are extensively discussed and analysed including concept realisation and analysis, DC converter topologies and design optimisation, DMPPT performance limitations, DMPPT control, and protection. The main concepts are reemphasised through a set of simulations. Finally, a list of potential research areas in this field is introduced.},

  abstract = {When the input or output voltage range of the LLC converter is wide, the switching frequency must extend its range to cover the required voltage, and the magnetizing inductance needs to be reduced to increase the voltage gain. This leads to reduced efficiency due to increased conduction losses. Consequently, this paper proposes an LLC resonant converter with a wide voltage range based on a reconfigurable voltage rectifier for high-DC bus applications. Owing to the reconfiguration of the rectifier by two active switches, the rectifier can operate in three operation modes--- voltage-doubler rectifier, a voltage-tripler rectifier, and a voltage-quadrupler rectifier. The proposed converter extends its voltage gain by changing the rectifier structure while the switching frequency operates near the resonant frequency. All MOSFET switches are turned on with zero-voltage switching, and all secondary diodes are turned off with zero-current switching. As a result, the performance efficiency is improved compared to that of the conventional LLC converter. A laboratory prototype was designed and experimentally tested to validate the operation and advantages of the proposed converter.},

The topology interfaces two PV panels as power sources by utilizing a dual half-bridge LLC circuit and multi-mode rectifier. In this topology, both PV sources use the same resonant tank for transferring energy to the load. The wide range of the switching frequency change for tracking maximum power point (MPP) of PVs sources reduces the efficiency of the dual-input LLC converter. This paper proposes a multi-mode rectifier on the secondary side of the dual-input LLC to limit the switching frequency change for tracking the MPP of PVs. By configuring a voltage-tripler, voltage-quadrupler, or voltage-fifthfolder rectifier and utilizing frequency modulation, a narrow frequency range and moderate transformer size are realized with an extended output voltage and high efficiency. In addition, soft-switching for primary MOSFETs and rectifier diodes is desired. A dual-input LLC resonant converter with a multi-mode rectifier for 300 W was built and tested. The related measured waveforms are demonstrated to prove the correctness and feasibility of the theoretical analysis.},

To resolve this, it is vital to utilize module level power electronics (MLPE) such as Solar Power Optimizers (SPOs). This paper introduced a non-isolated common ground non-inverting output voltage buck-boost converter as an SPO. Proposed converter benefits from continuous input and output currents which has a significant role in designing SPOs. Having a quadratic gain, beside acceptable step-down range are other features of the converter. Operating principle, design, steady-state, small-signal analysis, and dynamic performance of proposed converter are included. Proposed converter is compared with other buck-boost converters in terms of voltage gain, voltage stresses, continuous input and output current, and output polarity. To validate the performance of introduced converter, experimental results for a prototype with input voltage 24 V, output voltage 72 V for step-up and 15 V for step-down modes are given and results are examined. The maximum efficiency of the prototype is 93\% and 89\% for step-up and step-down modes, respectively. To evaluate the effect of proposed SPO for extracting maximum available power from PVs, simulation results of a grid connected PV system with two series connected SPOs is discussed.},

  abstract = {Many scientific, engineering and economic problems involve the optimisation of a set of parameters. These problems include examples like minimising the losses in a power grid by finding the optimal configuration of the components, or training a neural network to recognise images of people's faces. Numerous optimisation algorithms have been proposed to solve these problems, with varying degrees of success. The Particle Swarm Optimiser (PSO) is a relatively new technique that has been empirically shown to perform well on many of these optimisation problems. This thesis presents a theoretical model that can be used to describe the long-term behaviour of the algorithm. An enhanced version of the Particle Swarm Optimiser is constructed and shown to have guaranteed convergence on local minima. This algorithm is extended further, resulting in an algorithm with guaranteed convergence on global minima. A model for constructing cooperative PSO algorithms is developed, resulting in the introduction of two new PSO-based algorithms. Empirical results are presented to support the theoretical properties predicted by the various models, using synthetic benchmark functions to investigate specific properties. The various PSO-based algorithms are then applied to the task of training neural networks, corroborating the results obtained on the synthetic benchmark functions.},

In this paper, a new hybrid high voltage gain dc-dc converter is created by merging the standard boost converter with a coupled inductor and different switched-capacitor techniques. With a single switch and no requirement of higher duty cycle values, the proposed converter achieves a high voltage gain and high efficiency, in addition to lowered voltage and current stresses of the components. A 200-W prototype was implemented experimentally to evaluate the converter, which reached a maximum efficiency of 97.6\%.},

Finally, the system restriction regarding undesirable switching states' transitions is explained and the solution is presented.

Furthermore, through a series of simulations, it is observed that partial power processing based converters obtain reduced processed power ratio and efficiency results compared to conventional full power converters. So, with the aim of verifying the conclusions obtained through the simulations, two downscaled prototypes are assembled and tested.

Through the review 3 different partial power processing strategies are distinguished: Differential Power Converters, Partial Power Converters and Mixed strategies. Each strategy is subdivided into smaller groups that entail different architectures with their own advantages and disadvantages. Also, due to the lack of agreement that exists in the sources around the naming of the different architectures, this paper seeks to stablish a nomenclature that avoids confusion when indexing this type of architectures.

This part highlights that DC fast chargers are usually connected to an AC network or microgrid, whereas DC microgrids would be a better choice to increase the charging efficiency and reduce the costs. However, the lack of standards in terms of protection and metering made their spread limited for the moment. Moreover, the paper describes the power converter topologies typically adopted in DC fast charging stations and emerging solutions to interface EVs with both 400 V and 800 V powertrains. Then, the paper explains the main architectural features of DC fast charging stations connected to DC networks or microgrids because of their potential to become the standard infrastructure in this field. Furthermore, the energy management strategies for DC fast charging stations are discussed, taking into account their relevant goals.

This paper presents a multivariable-droop synchronous current converter control strategy for current management of weak grid/microgrid applications, and offers a systematic and straightforward design approach using the loop shaping technique. The controller integrates current regulation, management, and limitation that are applicable to weak grids and microgrids (MGs). The multivariable synchronous current converter enables superior decoupling of d- and q-axis currents in weak grids and/or resistive grids where these control variables are highly coupled due to converter operation at large load-angles. Therefore, stable connection of weak (high impedance) resistive MGs to utility grids is feasible. The multivariable droop concept also realizes real power sharing by simultaneous drooping of both frequency and voltage amplitude, which enhances load sharing accuracy in resistive and/or weak grids. Similar to its predecessor, synchronous converters, the controller can eliminate phase-locked loop (PLL) and provides a unified controller, PLL, and load manager in one simple control methodology. This can facilitate grid auto-synchronization, which can improve the stability of voltage source converters in weak grid applications. Also, the controller can participate in the power system frequency, and voltage regulation and control. To evaluate the performance of the controller, several simulations are conducted under various typical scenarios and conditions.},

Hence, there is an increasing need to explore and reveal the integration, optimization, and control strategies regarding the hybrid microgrid.

To make this possible, key aspects of their operation such as reliability and robustness must been in safe levels. To accomplish the latter, two different technologies have been proposed: (a) Virtual Synchronous Machines and (b) Smart Transformers. Despite all the benefits that each one of these technologies provide, solid-state transformers have not been very successful in operating as smart transformers. Then, hybrid transformers were proposed as a more feasible solution and with the capability of providing ancillary services to the distribution grid. In this paper, a new type of hybrid transformer that incorporate features of a virtual synchronous machine is proposed. The proposed transformer is capable of emulating virtual inertia as an ancillary service, and, at the same time, providing other basic services such as reactive power injection and voltage compensation. Simulation results provide evidence of the advantages of using this type of hybrid transformers in distribution grids.},

  abstract = {Inverter-based resources (IBRs) are essential for rapid microgrid restoration following blackouts, as they can provide black start services. However, transformer energization during a black start generates a magnetizing inrush that destabilizes the inverter, often leading to failure in grid restoration. This phenomenon represents a significant challenge for the effective deployment of IBRs in black start operations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) approach for inverter-based transformer energization aimed at enabling successful microgrid black start. The paper begins with an analysis of the flux characteristics of the transformer. Then, an autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) model is developed to predict the transformer's magnetizing current. A magnetizing inrush mitigation algorithm is then introduced, combining the ARX model with a classical two-level inverter voltage control strategy. Comparative simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating significant improvements in mitigating magnetizing inrush, achieving fast dynamic responses, and maintaining stable static waveforms.},

However, the existing QCM approaches impede the wide adoption of FSBB due to their implementation complexity. To address this issue and obtain a simple closed-loop control for output voltage, a real-time simplified four-quadrangle modulation was found without look-up tables or extra current detection. With this simplified control method, the whole control system can be fully implemented in digital controllers. Meanwhile, to aid the compensator design, a small signal model was proposed under QCM operation. The proposed small signal model shows a good agreement with the simulation results in the frequency domain. Finally, a Silicon Carbide (SiC)-based 50kW, 900V input, and 500V-1000V output FSBB converter was built to verify the proposed control scheme and the small-signal model.},

  abstract = {In order to process the energy generated by small wind turbines (SWT) in isolated systems or dc microgrids, two-stage configurations employing a rectifier and dc-dc converter have been suitable due to the power decoupling between the rectifier and dc-dc converter, adding facility to realize the maximum power point tracking regarding single-stage solutions. However, the losses of the system can be increased due to the additional dc-dc converter. To reduce this effect, partial-power converters (PPC) can be used, in which only a part of the power generated by the SWT system is processed by the converter. In this context, this article describes a theoretical and experimental study on a Full-Bridge dc-dc converter based on the partial-power processing (PPP) concept applied to SWT systems. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed structure, experimental results are presented for a 1.5 kW SWT, in which the Full-Bridge PPC processed only 70\% of the generated power.},

This paper proposes a decentralized virtual inertial control scheme for Hybrid Energy Storage systems (HESS) and ILC of Hybrid AC-DC microgrids to cumulatively operate as a synchronous generator. The proposed control scheme utilizes the high power density storage device such as ultra-capacitor integrated to DC side to operate as rotor mass to synthesize virtual inertia demanded by the power system and battery as a virtual governer to fulfill the steady state power deficit during islanded and community connected mode of operation. The proposed control scheme is validated through power hardware in loop simulation of a hardware prototype.},

  abstract = {Hybrid microgrids (HMGs) are attracting increasing interest in the electrical sector, driven by the need to enhance integration between alternating current (ac) and direct current (dc) sources and loads. The rising relevance of these microgrids (MG) originates from their ability to reduce the required conversion units, decreasing the complexity associated with the diverse characteristics of sources and loads. In this context, this study proposes a new topology for a hybrid bidirectional converter designed to serve as an interface between the ac and dc buses of an HMG, with specific applications in low-voltage distribution networks. The converter's ac port is three-phase, including a neutral to enable the use of single-phase loads, and adopts a multilevel approach based on coupled inductors. The use of coupled inductors in the ac port aims primarily at reducing the output current ripple, thereby allowing a decrease in the output filter inductor. In the dc port, the converter shares the same neutral leg as the ac port, resulting in a reduction in the number of semiconductors. The simulation and experimental results validate the performance of the proposed converter, demonstrating a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 3.1\% in voltages and currents.},

This approach can be viewed as a direct nonlinear extension of MPC with linear models and is easily tailored to include stabilizing constraints. Using this framework we consider the application of three active set strategies as well as interior point methods applied to both the NMPC and the QP subproblem. The first two active set methods (QPOPT and and QKWIK) are general purpose solvers that have been incorporated into SQP algorithms previously, while the third is a Schur complement approach that can easily exploit the sparse structure of the KKT matrix in MPC.},

To improve the capability of the controller, an MPC scheme is used which implements a discrete-time model of the system.

However, its widespread use for modeling and analysis of large-scale, general power systems is still a pending issue. One problem that arises when considering dq0 models is that they are typically based on local reference frames, and therefore linking different models is not straightforward. In this paper we propose to approach this problem by modeling the network and its components using a dq0 transformation that is based on a unified reference frame. We demonstrate this idea on the basis of synchronous machines and photovoltaic generators, and we also establish a dq0-based dynamic model of a transmission network. The resulting models all use a unified reference frame, and therefore can be directly linked to each other in simulation and analytically. The paper is accompanied by a free software package (Levron, Y. and Belikov, J. Toolbox for Modeling and Analysis of Power Networks in the DQ0 Reference Frame. 2016. www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/58702) that constructs the proposed dynamic models and provides tools for dynamic simulations and stability studies based on dq0 quantities.},

An RL agent, educated using an Actor-Critic (AC) approach is capable to make effective real-time decisions and evaluations. The agent is trained in the Simulink environment, enriched with Simscape components to enhance the performance. By processing four continuous inputs, i.e. the speed error, its integral, its derivative, and the motor armature current, the agent outputs a PWM signal to control the four H-bridge switches that drive the DC motor. The reward function encourages the agent to learn an optimal control policy that minimizes both the tracking error and the armature current. The simulation results show that the RL-based speed controller outperforms the traditional controllers using cascade PI controllers.},

The modern power grid requires flexible energy utilization but presents challenges in the case of a high penetration degree of renewable energy, among which wind and solar photovoltaics are typical sources. The integration level of the DPGS into the grid plays a critical role in developing sustainable and resilient power systems, especially with highly intermittent renewable energy resources. To address the challenging issues and, more importantly, to leverage the energy generation, stringent demands from both utility operators and consumers have been imposed on the DPGS. Furthermore, as the core of energy conversion, numerous power electronic converters employing advanced control techniques have been developed for the DPGS to consolidate the integration. In light of the above, this paper reviews the power-conversion and control technologies used for DPGSs. The impacts of the DPGS on the distributed grid are also examined, and more importantly, strategies for enhancing the connection and protection of the DPGS are discussed.},

A factor-variable k/sub 0/ (proportional to the time of application of vector V/sub 7/) was introduced. By changing k/sub 0/ from zero to one, the duration of application of V/sub 7/ can be changed from 0\% to 100\% of the combined application time for zero-state vectors. Correlation between modified space-vector and triangle-comparison methods (with added zero sequence) was established. The influence of factor k/sub 0/ on characteristics of the PWM was investigated. An expression for the optimal value of k/sub 0/ that provides minimum ripple in the load current was derived. Salient features of the new algorithm are extended linearity (up to a modulation index of 1.154), reduced switching losses, and ability to change the current spectrum by changing k/sub 0/ every sampling time. The developed algorithm is suitable for microprocessor and analog implementation. Since the new algorithm combines the theory of space-vector PWM with the ease of implementation of a triangle-comparison PWM, it is named "hybrid" PWM (HPWM).},

  abstract = {Predictive control indicates a wide family of advanced control techniques that in last decade have been investigated in several studies and researches in the electrical drive field. This paper considers one of them, named Model Predictive Control (MPC). There are many advantages and interesting aspects in the use of this control technique compared to more traditional techniques that are usually employed in electrical drives. The typical cascade structure of FOC algorithms, for instance, can be avoided by implementing a single controller that manages both speed and currents. The innovation proposed within this paper is the application of Model Predictive Control to an IPM synchronous motor drive. Herein, special attention is given to the system's non-linearities and how the controller can be modified to realize flux-weakening and other control strategies. After a detailed description of the strategy that has been implemented, in the last part of the paper most important results obtained by simulations and by testing on a real drive are shown and discussed.},

Particularly, three-phase PWM voltage-source and current-source rectifiers are thoroughly studied using the graphical capabilities of this approach, namely, complex signal flow graphs. These are used to directly and intuitively derive high-performance nonlinear control laws based on input-output feedback linearization. Specifically, a cascaded and a paralleled control scheme are investigated for the voltage-source rectifier, whereas a cascaded scheme is considered for the current-source rectifier. Under these strategies both converters exhibit linear and decoupled d-q axes dynamics, while also attaining a reactive power compensation capacity. Moreover, linearization of their respective dc-link voltage and current loops utterly enforces and ensures their operating stability. All this is achieved without the elaborate mathematical complexity of input-output linearization, effectively shunned out by the proposed complex state-space approach. Finally, experimental results from 5-kVA digital-signal-processor-based laboratory prototypes verify the analysis and downright performance evinced by these AFE converters.},

  abstract = {Due to the increasing integration of renewable energies into the distribution grid, a deterioration of the grid power quality is expected. Consisting of a low-frequency transformer and a fractionally rated power electronic converter, hybrid transformers (HTs) can be applied to ensure a high power quality by controlling voltage, active and reactive power dynamically. For the application in conventional grids, HTs have to withstand considerable overvoltages and overcurrents during voltage surges or short circuits. Although HTs recently gained increasing research interest, protection requirements and protection concepts have not been discussed yet. These aspects are, however, essential to evaluate the practical potential of HTs. In this article, protection requirements are derived and a protection concept is developed and verified by simulations and experiments for a 100-kVA hybrid distribution transformer. Although the protection concept has a considerable impact on the design and performance of the converter, it increases the total losses and volume of the HT only insignificantly. An efficiency of 98.48\% is achievable for an HT including protection, which is only slightly lower than the efficiency of 98.64\% for a comparable conventional transformer. This renders the HT a promising solution for today's and future ac grids.},

Due to limitations in the switching speed of MOSFETs and delays introduced to avoid current shoot-through, the gain function of such converter exhibits a discontinuous behaviour at the transition from buck to boost operating mode and vice versa. The discontinuous gain is the cause of undesired transients in the PV voltage and PV power. This paper focuses on a solution for the gain discontinuity issue by operating the converter in buck and boost mode simultaneously during the transition. Particular attention is devoted to the duty ratio compensation technique employed when operating the converter in both modes, and a criteria to set the converter duty ratios during the transition is given. The methodology presented should come as an aid for those considering the FSBB converter topology as a candidate for PV module-integrated converters.},

  abstract = {Distribution systems are under constant stress due to their highly variable operating conditions, which jeopardize distribution transformers and lines, degrading the end-user service. Due to transformer regulation, variable loads can generate voltage profiles out of the acceptable bands recommended by grid codes, affecting the quality of service. At the same time, nonlinear loads, such as diode bridge rectifiers without power factor correction systems, generate nonlinear currents that affect the distribution transformer operation, reducing its lifetime. Variable loads can be commonly found at domiciliary levels due to the random operation of home appliances, but recently also due to electric vehicle charging stations, where the distribution transformer can cyclically vary between no-load, rated and overrated load. Thus, the distribution transformer can not safely operate under highly-dynamic and stressful conditions, requiring the support of alternative systems. Among the existing solutions, hybrid transformers, which are composed of a conventional transformer and a power converter, are an interesting alternative to cope with several power quality problems.

Among the available HDT configurations, the one that connects a series/parallel converter on the primary/secondary side can be highlighted. This configuration improves the voltage and current waveforms on the transformer and regulates the voltage supplied to the ac microgrid. Nonetheless, this HDT suffers from a circulating active power flow (CAPF), affecting its efficiency. Moreover, during the unbalanced operation of the HDT, an additional CAPF component exists. Depending on the grid and load conditions and whether the parallel converter compensates for the load unbalances, the CAPF can either increase or decrease. Although the CAPF can be eliminated by employing the dc port of the HDT, it is not always possible to extract energy from it. This work contributes with the analysis of the operation of an HDT under an unbalanced grid voltage and load, along with an extended CAPF model that considers the losses of the HDT. The effect of the unbalanced components on the CAPF is analyzed, and the conditions in which the CAPF is minimized are obtained. Nonetheless, in most scenarios, a minimum CAPF does not coincide with the maximum efficiency of the HDT. Therefore, the conditions for achieving maximum efficiency are also determined. A simpler suboptimal condition is obtained due to the complexity of requiring precise parameters and operating conditions of the HDT. Moreover, the suboptimal condition allows for improving the power quality of the HDT. Therefore, a certain amount of CAPF is desired to operate the HDT properly.},

When the series converter is connected to the primary side, it is possible to use this converter to regulate the load voltage. Nonetheless, if there is no proper care in how the voltage is injected, there is a risk of producing a DC offset on the flux of the main Low-Frequency Transformer (LFT). In that case, the transformer can generate inrush currents. The latter can damage equipment and trigger security systems. This work presents an HDT connected in series to the medium-voltage grid through Coupling Transformers (CTs). The series converter is used to regulate the flux of the main LFT to its rated value and indirectly regulate the load voltage. A flux regulator and a simple flux estimator are presented. Results show that the series converter can successfully regulate the distribution transformer flux, controlling the inrush current and removing the magnetic flux offset from the CTs.},

  abstract = {Thanks to the push towards sustainable energy, modern electric networks are witnessing the spread of photovoltaic and wind renewable sources, which are the main responsible for the great and great diffusion of converter-interfaced distributed generators. The number of these converter-interfaced sources is increasing at such a level that it is having a significant impact on the stability and operation of the electric grids. This raises the issue of properly integrating power converters for energy-source interface into the electric grid, so that they can concur to its stable and performing control. The very rich scientific production testifies that such a question is greatly attracting the attention of the international scientific community. Grid-connected converters interfacing distributed generators are classified according to their operation and performed task, but the scientific literature has not still provided a unique classification. This paper makes an overview of the two main classifications used in the literature, highlighting the peculiarities of the two classifications, their similarities and differences, and describing the different categories of converters, their tasks, up to date control strategies and solutions for the most important issues found in the recent literature. Moreover, in the attempt of providing a merge between the two classifications and avoid confusion about~the concept of ``grid forming'', used with different meaning by both the classifications, a new nomenclature for converter categories is proposed. Given that most of research lines try to conform the new concepts to the traditional ones, focus is posed on the distributed generators with traditional non-communication based primary control.},

The transient problem has been the most serious problem for power supplies needing the output voltage in the mid-range of the input voltage. The maximum transient arises when the input voltage becomes almost equal to the output voltage. Selecting the best approach involves a tradeoff among cost, efficiency, and output noise or ripple. There are various techniques used to solve the problem of transients. However, most of the methods have drawbacks such as comparatively higher transients or lower efficiency because of the longer switching operations. This paper describes few methods already been used to solve the transient problem and points out the demerits of those methods. In addition, a new combination method, which combines buck and boost modes during the transition mode, is described in this paper to minimize the transients at the output of the converters when the input voltage is near to the output voltage. Mathematical equations have been put forward to support the proposed idea for the transient minimization. Simulation results have been added to make a comparative analysis of transient response of this method with respect to the other methods},

For reliable operation of an IHMG, achieving distributed generators' power sharing (DGPS) throughout the entire IHMG and ICs' power sharing (IPS) is the main objective in an IHMG. To improve efficiency of an IHMG, minimizing operating costs of DGs is required and thus cost-minimized DGPS needs to be achieved. Similarly, when multiple ICs operate in an IHMG, efficiency-maximized IPS can further improve the efficiency of an IHMG, as total loss of ICs can vary by the IPS ratios. Thus, this paper proposes a distributed power sharing strategy to achieve cost-minimized DGPS and efficiency-maximized IPS simultaneously, without any communication lines for DGs. Incremental cost-based droop controlled DGs and distributed controlled ICs are coordinated for cost-minimized DGPS and a distributed optimal power sharing method of ICs is proposed to achieve efficiency-maximized IPS. The proposed strategy secures both cost-minimized DGPS and efficiency-maximized IPS, with only sparse communication lines among ICs, thus resulting in a significant improvement in IHMG efficiency and reliability.},

  abstract = {Design of tracking controller for quadrotor is an important issue for many engineering fields such as COVID-19 epidemic prevention, intelligent agriculture, military photography and rescue nowadays. This study applies the feedback linearized method and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) method using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to analysis and stabilize the highly nonlinear quadrotor system without applying any nonlinear function approximator that includes neural network approach and fuzzy approach. The article proposes a new method based on the firstly proposed convergence rate formula to achieve the optimal weighting matrices of LQR such that the composite controller can reduce the amplitudes of system control inputs. Determination of the LQR tuning parameters is conventionally achieved via trial and error approach. In addition to being very troublesome, it is difficult to find the globally best tuning matrices with LQR method. This article firstly uses the convergence rate formula of the nonlinear system as the fitness function of LQR approach by using PSO to take the place of the trial and error method. The generalities and implications of proposed approach are globally valid, whereas the Jacobian linearized approach is locally valid due to the Taylor expansion theorem. In addition to these two major achievements, the significant innovation of the proposed method is to possess ``simultaneously'' additional performances including the almost disturbance decoupling, input amplitude reduction, tuning parameter optimization and globally exponential stability performances. Comparative examples show that the convergence rate with our proposed optimal controller using the PSO algorithm is larger than the fuzzy method, and better than the singular perturbation method with high-gain feedback.},

The input and output of the DC-DCX are in-series and connected to the total-input voltage. Therefore, part of the total input power is directly transferred to the intermediate bus without conversion, and the voltage and current stresses of the DC-DCX can be reduced. The DC-DCX is implemented with a synchronous-rectification LLC resonant converter. A hybrid synchronous driving scheme is presented for the LLC to further improve the conversion efficiency. In order to emphasize the superiority of the proposed driving scheme, the comparisons between the traditional and the newly proposed synchronous driving scheme are presented in this paper. Finally, a 36V{$\sim$}72V input, 10V{$\sim$}14V output and 100W-rated prototype is built and tested to verify the analysis, also help to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.},

The MR-MIMO architecture couples a large number of modular dc--ac cells with a single magnetic core which processes multiway bidirectional power flow. The system voltage and current ratings can be linearly extended and reconfigured by connecting the dc--ac cells in series or parallel. The MR-MIMO architecture decouples the voltage rating and current rating of the basic cells, and offers much lower device stress than traditional wide-operation range multiport dc--dc converters. The key contributions of this article include: 1) a multicell reconfigurable 12-winding MIMO converter with high performance across a wide range; 2) a hybrid time-sharing and phase-shift control strategy; and 3) a systematic method of designing multiwinding PCB transformers. The MR-MIMO architecture allows one power converter being used for multiple purposes through software reconfiguration. The work presented in this article proved that it is possible to gain significantly design flexibility in a multicell reconfigurable architecture without sacrificing the efficiency or power density. A 500-W 4-port energy router with 12 modular cells and a 12-winding transformer has been built and tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MR-MIMO architecture. The energy router maintains over 95\% efficiency across a wide range of input and output voltage options.},

Microgrids consist of multiple distributed generators (DGs) that are usually integrated via power electronic inverters. In order to enhance power quality and power distribution reliability, microgrids need to operate in both grid-connected and island modes. Consequently, microgrids can suffer performance degradation as the operating conditions vary due to abrupt mode changes and variations in bus voltages and system frequency. This paper presents controller design and optimization methods to stably coordinate multiple inverter-interfaced DGs and to robustly control individual interface inverters against voltage and frequency disturbances. Droop-control concepts are used as system-level multiple DG coordination controllers, and control theory is applied to device-level inverter controllers. Optimal control parameters are obtained by particle-swarm-optimization algorithms, and the control performance is verified via simulation studies.},

Soft-switching characteristics are also suitable for these conversion topologies and DCX converters are then serious candidates to be used. DCX provides an isolated high efficiency solution but the DCX-based two-stage converter topology must be optimized in order to obtain better efficiency and energy yield.

A significant challenge in the design of the weighting factors within the MPC is that inappropriate selections can adversely affect the system's performance, given their direct impact on the cost function. The methodology presented aims to simplify the design of the weighting factors in the MPC applied to the DFIG using the root locus method (RLM), based on ensuring the stability of closed-loop eigenvalues while optimizing performance related to power regulation and energy quality. Furthermore, performance maps were created to evaluate the effects of weighting factors and predictive horizons on system dynamics. Therefore, this article proposes to design MPC's weighting factors to ensure stability and performance of grid-injected energy by regulating DFIG rotor currents, with experimental validation on a test bench.},

Various topologies and control schemes have been documented aiming at reducing the cost and improving the performance of the compensation system. Hybrid active filters inherit the efficiency of passive filters and the improved performance of active filters, and thus constitute a viable improved approach for harmonic compensation. In this paper a parallel hybrid filter is studied for current harmonic compensation. The hybrid filter is formed by a single tuned LC filter per phase and a small-rated power three-phase active filter, which are directly connected in series without any matching transformer. The required rating of the active filter is much smaller than a conventional standalone active filter would be. No additional switching-ripple filter is required for the hybrid filter because the LC filter functions not only as a harmonic filter but also as a switching-ripple filter around 10 kHz. Simulation results and experimental results obtained in laboratory confirmed the validity and effectiveness of the control},

  abstract = {This article proposes a novel isolated three-port dc/dc converter based on a series resonant converter and a dual active bridge (DAB) converter for electric-vehicle charging stations with fast and slow charging functions. With this three-port structure, the proposed converter has fewer components, which results in lower system cost and volume compared with separate charger systems. A simple control method using phase-shift and frequency modulations was developed to control the output power of the fast and slow charging ports simultaneously. An optimal phase-shift angle was also derived to minimize the transformer current for when only the DAB converter is operated for slow charging. To verify the converter operation, a 5-kW SiC-based prototype with a power density of 2.74 kW/dm3 was built and tested with an input voltage of 600 V. A high-efficiency performance over a wide output voltage range has been achieved, and the peak efficiency is 98.2\% at the rated conditions.},

All feasible Step-Up and Step-Down PPP schemes are evaluated and analysed. Suitable performance metrics are derived to compare the various schemes from the perspective of wide voltage variation seen in battery charging applications. A systematic methodology to derive Step-Up/Down-type PPP converters that facilitate bidirectional power flow is elucidated. A phase-shifted full-bridge converter (PSFBC) topology is selected to implement the PPP charging converter. The PPP approach improves the overall system efficiency, reduces switch stresses, and reduces the size of the power converter. The design and modelling considerations for the PSFBC topology for EV battery charging are elucidated. The designed topology is validated using switching circuit simulations and experimental results. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate that a PSFBC that is rated to handle an active power of 1.5 kW can be used to transfer 3.6 kW of power to charge the battery while achieving a system efficiency of 97.5\%.},

  abstract = {To increase the energy yield of photovoltaic (PV) systems in the presence of module-level power mismatches, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) should be performed by converters at module level. Using module-level converters at the output of the PV panels adds a constant loss even when there is no power mismatch, which increases the overall system losses and compromises part of the energy yield improvement. To decrease this constant loss especially when there is no power mismatch, partial power processing (PPP) concept is used in this article to achieve a new high-frequency and high-efficiency module-integrated PV converter, which can achieve full range MPPT and maximum possible efficiency when there is no mismatch. To overcome the challenge of limited MPPT range for partial power converters, a special pulse density modulation technique is proposed, which preserves the merits of PPP and renders full range MPPT. A 220-W prototype converter is implemented to justify the converter principal of operation and analyses. The proposed converter reached 99.6\%--96.5\% efficiency for the power mismatches in the PV module ranging from 0\% to 50\% of the maximum module power generation capability, respectively. The efficiency drop is shown to be linear with power mismatch level without any abrupt reductions that is commonly observed in conventional PV module-integrated converters.},

To improve the power quality in the grid, the distributed generation unit can be used as an active power filter (APF). When an active power filtering function is desired, the converter should have a neutral wire to allow neutral currents to flow. Therefore, two four-wire topologies, the four-leg and split-link converter, are compared in this paper. The comparison criteria are the ease of control, EMC performance, mid-point control, dc-bus voltage utilization and circuit complexity. It is concluded that a split-link topology is the best choice compared to a four-leg converter. For the same circuit complexity and dc-bus voltage utilization, the split-link topology results in easier current control and less EMC-problems.},

Within this scenario, solar photovoltaics (PV) stand out as an essential source, supporting the transition to a cleaner and more efficient energy system. Despite notable advances in PV technology, their limitations substantially challenge solar energy harvesting efficiency. Owing to its negative consequences, partial shading has motivated the search for innovative and practical solutions to improve the performance of PV systems. This research explicitly addresses these limitations by proposing a reconfigurable system using a multi-port converter to independently extract the energy generated by shaded and unshaded panels by implementing a reconfiguration strategy using the Perturb and Observe (P \& O) technique. The reconfiguration strategy results are encouraging since 31\% of the energy extracted from the unshaded panels is recovered when the system is in partial shade presence. This breakthrough contributes to the efficiency of PV system optimization, thus highlighting the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy as a concrete solution to the current challenges in the solar energy field.},

The performance of design would be greatly reduced, when the system exists unknown disturbances or uncertainty. Therefore, some scholars pointed out that the dependency on the system models can be eliminated by data-driven design schemes. In this paper, the reinforcement learning-based methods are included, which appeal to attentions gradually. The disturbances rejection problem for motion control systems is studied based on reinforcement learning. Considering the continuity of state space and action space, a method based on deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to reject the periodic disturbances. Proposed deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) based algorithms are compared in simulation. The simulation results show that the periodic disturbances of the motion control systems can be rejected effectively with the proposed reinforcement learning controller.},

The first stage of control scheme is depended upon the P-V/Q-f droop control method, it is used when link-impedance is mainly resistive in nature. The second stage of control scheme is comprised to compensate for the deviation of voltage and current, which are depending upon load under grid connected mode and islanding mode. While changing the load on the AC side under grid connected mode, the operation is transferred to islanding mode. The two-stage control scheme is also utilized for bifurcation of active and reactive power. The proposed control scheme is verified in MATLAB/ Simulink environment.},

The relationship between the model and real communities of biological oscillators is discussed; examples include populations of synchronously flashing fireflies, crickets that chirp in unison, electrically synchronous pacemaker cells, and groups of women whose menstrual cycles become mutually synchronized.},

Here we present a novel, concise, and closed-form condition for synchronization of the fully nonlinear, non-equilibrium, and dynamic network. Our synchronization condition can be stated elegantly in terms of the network topology and parameters, or equivalently in terms of an intuitive, linear, and static auxiliary system. Our results significantly improve upon the existing conditions advocated thus far, they are provably exact for various interesting network topologies and parameters, they are statistically correct for almost all networks, and they can be applied equally to synchronization phenomena arising in physics and biology as well as in engineered oscillator networks such as electric power networks.

An analysis of the S-PPCs' characteristics, topologies, and applications concerning the active and nonactive power processing is presented. The power processing factor (PPF) is then defined, which refers to the active power and depends exclusively on the voltage regulation range. The so-called Fryze power factor (PF) is used to evaluate the nonactive power processed, which depends on the topology voltage and current waveforms. Due to the lack of research around step-up/-down S-PPCs, this article presents the restrictions and requirements for the design of this type of S-PPCs. Finally, it is demonstrated that the turns ratio of magnetic devices can be optimized to reduce the nonactive power and improve the converter Fryze PF, ensuring PPP. In order to validate the analyses, two 2200-W prototypes were built and evaluated for a photovoltaic (PV) application example. Experimental results show that the reduction of both the active and nonactive power processed by the S-PPCs results in lower component ratings and higher efficiencies.},

  abstract = {AC/DC hybrid microgrids (HMGs) represent a promising architecture that allows the hosting of a mix of ac/dc energy resources and ac/dc loads. Despite their potential, when islanded, HMGs impose operational challenges among of which are precise and stable power sharing, frequency restoration, and voltage regulation. Imprecise power sharing can result in some distributed generators (DGs) being overloaded, while others being underloaded. This article proposes an optimal-power-flow-based optimal power sharing (OPS) scheme to optimize the droop characteristics of DGs and interlinking converters for global power sharing in a multi-DG HMG regardless of DG location and type. The optimized droop parameters might jeopardize the microgrid stability. Thus, the proposed OPS scheme preserves stable power sharing through stability-constrained optimization of the droop characteristics. In addition to DG overloading because of unequal power sharing, voltage-sensitive loads could possibly suffer from voltage deviations because of drooping the voltage with the load increase. The proposed OPS strategy enjoys the ability to regulate the ac/dc voltage within a desired range and restore the nominal frequency. Steady-state and time-domain simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed sharing scheme in achieving the underlying objectives. Test results also prove the capability of the OPS scheme in zonal power sharing in the case of a distribution grid with multizone ac/dc microgrids.},

  abstract = {The bidirectional power flow through the interlinking converter (IC), in ac/dc hybrid microgrids (HMGs) consisting of distributed generators (DGs) with droop controllers, plays an important role on the stability of such systems during islanding. This paper investigates the impact of the power flow direction on the small-signal stability of islanded droop-based HMGs. Firstly, a linearized state-space model of an HMG is developed. Secondly, eigenvalue analysis is carried out to realize the dominant modes, which are the rightmost eigenvalues. Thirdly, participation factor analysis is performed to identify the system and control parameters that effect stability the most. Lastly, sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the critical droop gains and stability margin. It is observed from the eigenvalue and sensitivity analysis that the dominant modes of HMGs become more stable as more power flows from dc to ac subgrid. On the contrary, an increase in the power flow from ac to dc subgrid degrades the HMG stability. Additionally, the sensitivity of the dominant modes to changes in ac and dc droop gains is studied under bidirectional power flow through the IC to ascertain their impact on the stability margins. Finally, time-domain simulations, in MATLAB/Simulink, suggest that more generation on the dc subgrid would enhance the overall HMG stability margin during islanding.},

  abstract = {A promising configuration for future smart grids is an AC/DC hybrid topology that enables the integration of AC/DC energy resources and modern loads, thus permitting the consequent formation of AC/DC hybrid microgrids (HMGs). An understanding of AC/DC HMGs and their operational premise during islanding will certainly pave the way toward the realization of a future smart grid that includes a plug-and-play feature. However, the planning and operation of such isolated and hybrid systems are reliant on a powerful and efficient power flow tool. To this end, this paper proposes a novel unified, generic, and flexible power flow algorithm for isolated AC/DC HMGs. The power flow subproblems related to AC and DC subgrids are described mathematically by a set of linear and nonlinear equations and are solved simultaneously using a Newton trust-region method. The proposed algorithm is generic in the sense that it includes consideration of the unique characteristics of islanded AC/DC HMGs: a variety of possible topologies, droop controllability of the distributed resources (DRs), and bidirectionality of the power flow in the interlinking converters (ICs). The new power flow formulation is flexible and permits the easy incorporation of any changes in DR operating modes and IC control strategies. The developed algorithm was tested and applied for analyzing selected operational and control aspects of isolated AC/DC HMGs, including inaccurate power sharing and interlinking converters characterized by differing control strategies. The proposed load flow program can form the basis of and provide direction for further studies of isolated AC/DC HMGs.},

  abstract = {Hybrid microgrids (HMGs) are impacted by a wide range of operational issues, which can lead to technical challenges for these systems. Power management and power sharing accuracy remain two major concerns due to lack of appropriate control strategies for bidirectional DC-DC converters (BDCs), which transfer power between distributed generations (DGs), such as electric vehicles (EVs), and HMGs. Similarly, interlinking converters (ICs), which are essential for power exchange between the AC and DC sides, can further intensify this challenge. Such deficiencies can pose threats to efficient operation of HMGs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 3-D droop-based control scheme for BDCs, designed to coordinate the performance of both EVs and BDCs on the DC side. This approach ensures accurate power sharing between BDCs despite unequal line resistances and enhances the overall power management of the HMG by involving EVs in meeting the load demand. Additionally, a novel approach for decoupling the charging and discharging modes of the EVs is introduced to eliminate circulating power among parallel BDCs. Consequently, BDC losses will be minimized, and their operational capacity remains unburdened, as unnecessary performance is avoided. Furthermore, a multi-purpose IC, formed by integrating a conventional single-stage IC with an adjustable distribution static synchronous compensator (DSTATCOM), equipped with a coordinated 3-D droop control is suggested. This not only facilitates the AC side voltage regulation (VR) through optimal reactive power compensation, but also ensures accurate reactive power sharing among parallel ICs. To accomplish this, the capacitance of the DC-link of the DSTATCOM is optimized by precisely tuning the proposed 3-D droop gains of the IC. The effectiveness of this control strategy is demonstrated and compared with other methods in the literature using an HMG testbed.},

  abstract = {Droop-based control strategies are generally used in hybrid microgrids (HMGs) for voltage and frequency regulation in the dc and ac microgrids (MGs). The control of interlinking converters (ICs) that connect ac and dc MGs plays a vital role in the stability and efficiency of HMGs. However, conventional P-V droops for the dc side may not be effective due to line resistances and local nature of voltage. Also, conventional Q-V droops for the ac side may result in circulating power and current among parallel ICs diminishing their performance. In this paper, dc voltage harmonic frequencies are employed to create a global variable in the dc side of HMGs and to introduce an efficient droop control strategy for the dc MG without deteriorating power quality. Accordingly, accurate active power sharing is achieved and circulating power is eliminated. In addition, a threedimensional (3-D) droop is suggested for voltage control at the ac MG using virtual impedances. Thus, proper reactive power sharing is accomplished among parallel ICs, while circulating currents are suppressed as well. The optimal gains of the 3-D droop are determined via an optimization problem. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated by examining it on a typical HMG in different situations.},

Existing studies have often overlooked the compounded effects of bidirectional power flows and the dynamic nature of EV charging loads on system stability. The proposed strategy focuses on the interlinking converter (ILC) and employs an anti-windup (AW) mechanism combined with proportional-integral (PI) control to address stability issues caused by bidirectional power flows, variable load demands, and low DC-link voltage fluctuations. To fine-tune the AW and PI gains, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used, ensuring robust control performance that responds effectively to fluctuating power inputs from EV chargers. Compared to existing methods, this approach stabilizes power sharing between AC and DC sub-grids, reduces voltage fluctuations, enhances transient response, and minimizes grid current total harmonic distortion (THD). Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the control strategy, highlighting its capability to maintain microgrid (MG) stability under dynamic conditions and varied operating scenarios. The study affirms the feasibility of AW control for HMGs, offering a reliable solution for resilient energy distribution in modern electrical grids.},

In this work, we evaluate the possibilities provided by modern High-Level Synthesis tools to facilitate the fast-prototyping of implicit MPC schemes in reconfigurable logic devices that can overcome typical software limitations in terms of execution time and real-time requirements. In specific, we report a case-study that simulates a DER system controlled through an MPC scheme that uses the iterative Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to solve the related optimization problem required for each control sampling interval. Experimental results using a Xilinx ZCU104 platform show that implementing the core of the ADMM algorithm in hardware reduces up to 10x the execution time of an MPC iteration in comparison to a software implementation executing in the same platform. The results provide experimental evidence about the potential of FPGAs for the implementation of advanced control schemes for DERs operating in microgrids.},

In this article, a novel distributed secondary control strategy for hybrid ac/dc-microgrids is presented which coordinates the control actions of the ac and dc sides. The proposed control scheme simultaneously regulates ac-voltage magnitude and frequency, as well as the dc-voltage magnitude, by including the interlinking converters in the control strategy via a distributed consensus approach. This improves the power-sharing accuracy and secondary control restoration of the variables in both ac and dc sides of the microgrid. Moreover, the proposed methodology avoids the circulating currents which are typically produced in systems with multiple interlinking converters.

Each converter station requires four PI controllers to be tuned in the decoupled d-q vector control scheme, and with the bidirectional HVDC system, the required PI controllers are doubled. Tuning these many controllers using conventional methods is a challenging task, especially if the parameters of the converter stations are different. A novel approach to tune the PI controllers for a bidirectional HVDC system using the time-domain performance indices is presented in this paper. The time-domain performance indices are optimized using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results of the proposed tuning method show that the proposed method not only gives superior results but also is less cumbersome to tune compared to conventional methods like modulus optimum (MO).},

Besides, the nominal value of the semiconductors is low due to these are clamped to the capacitors available on the voltage multiplier units. The normalized voltage stress across the semiconductors is low which this case is compared in the comparison section.

  abstract = {Data-driven control approaches of permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) have gained significant attention due to their ability to eliminate reliance on analytical machine models and parameters. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a viable method for achieving a data-driven current control of the PMSM drive without the necessity of machine parameter information. In this approach, RL is trained offline to learn an optimal control policy, resulting in a computationally efficient controller compared to other data-driven control methods. However, standard RL methods struggle to adapt to new operating conditions and different parameter sets, reducing system performance and robustness. This research proposes a multiset robust RL (MSR-RL) based current control method for PMSM drives. MSR-RL leverages multitask RL to optimize a single policy that can generalize and provide robust performance across multiple parameter sets. The parameter sets, referred to as contexts, are represented as contextual Markov decision processes (CMDPs), capturing the dynamics associated with each parameter set. During the training phase, CMDPs with shared information are clustered into models. These models are then utilized to generate a unified policy that remains robust to all clustered and unseen models. The effectiveness of MSR-RL is validated through comparison with standard RL based on numerical simulations, experimental tests, and robustness evaluation. The findings highlight the advantages of MSR-RL in terms of adaptability, robustness, and performance of PMSM current control.},

Potential higher current stress on battery during transient operation can considerably reduce its expected lifetime, while battery size is overrated to respond under heavy transient demands. The regenerative braking capability is also getting limited due to its charging dynamic constraints. Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) based on batteries and supercapacitors (SC) have the potential to solve this issue. However, SCs size and weight can deteriorate the power density of the solution.

A comprehensive efficiency analysis is provided, while transient dynamic results are provided to validate the proposed power configuration.},

This algorithm is a very promising control technique for power electronics converters and its use for reactive power control of hybrid filter has not been reported in the literature yet. This paper uses the FCS-MPC in a multivariable structure along with an adaptive notch filter to damp resonance. The main purpose is to improve the dynamic response of the HAPF. Simulation as well as practical results prove the feasibility of FCS-MPC application in HAPF reactive power control. The dynamic response of the equipment was significantly improved and represents the main contribution of this paper. As a result, the FCS-MPC allows tracking fluctuations and abrupt changes in load reactive power.},

The method is more attractive than others since it is not a mere extension of methods employed in single-phase systems, but comes from the application of a quite powerful and synthetic mathematical tool specifically studied for the representation of three-wire three-phase systems in any possible condition: the Park transformation and the Park vectors. It is proven that the application of this method leads to the definition of two quantities, the real and the imaginary power, that are measurable in a quite simpler way than those proposed by other theories. The two satisfy all properties typical of the electrical power and are directly related, under sinusoidal and balanced conditions, to the active and reactive powers. It is shown how this method fits with other proposed methods that can be regarded in terms of this more general theory.{$<>$}},

In this nature-based algorithm, individuals are referred to as particles and fly through the search space seeking for the global best position that minimises (or maximises) a given problem. Today, PSO is one of the most well-known and widely used swarm intelligence algorithms and metaheuristic techniques, because of its simplicity and ability to be used in a wide range of applications. However, in-depth studies of the algorithm have led to the detection and identification of a number of problems with it, especially convergence problems and performance issues. Consequently, a myriad of variants, enhancements and extensions to the original version of the algorithm, developed and introduced in the mid-1990s, have been proposed, especially in the last two decades. In this article, a systematic literature review about those variants and improvements is made, which also covers the hybridisation and parallelisation of the algorithm and its extensions to other classes of optimisation problems, taking into consideration the most important ones. These approaches and improvements are appropriately summarised, organised and presented, in order to allow and facilitate the identification of the most appropriate PSO variant for a particular application.},

This developed theoretical analysis reveals that a conventional power feedback control scheme makes the UPFC induce power fluctuation in transient states. The conventional control scheme cannot attenuate the power fluctuation, and so the time constant of damping is independent of active and reactive power feedback gains integrated in its control circuit. This paper proposes an advanced control scheme which has the function of successfully damping out the power fluctuation. A UPFC rated at 10 kVA is designed and constructed, which is a combination of a series device consisting of three single-phase pulsewidth modulation (PWM) converters and a shunt device consisting of a three-phase diode rectifier. Although the dynamics of the shunt device are not included, it is possible to confirm and demonstrate the performance of the series device. Experimental results agree well with both analytical and simulated results and show viability and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract = {Throughout the centuries, nature has been a source of inspiration, with much still to learn from and discover about. Among many others, Swarm Intelligence (SI), a substantial branch of Artificial Intelligence, is built on the intelligent collective behavior of social swarms in nature. One of the most popular SI paradigms, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO), is presented in this work. Many changes have been made to PSO since its inception in the mid 1990s. Since their learning about the technique, researchers and practitioners have developed new applications, derived new versions, and published theoretical studies on the potential influence of various parameters and aspects of the algorithm. Various perspectives are surveyed in this paper on existing and ongoing research, including algorithm methods, diverse application domains, open issues, and future perspectives, based on the Systematic Review~(SR) process. More specifically, this paper analyzes the existing research on methods and applications published between 2017 and 2019 in a technical taxonomy of the picked content, including hybridization, improvement, and variants of PSO, as well as real-world applications of the algorithm categorized into: health-care, environmental, industrial, commercial, smart city, and general aspects applications. Some technical characteristics, including accuracy, evaluation environments, and proposed case study are involved to investigate the effectiveness of different PSO methods and applications. Each addressed study has some valuable advantages and unavoidable drawbacks which are discussed and has accordingly yielded some hints presented for addressing the weaknesses of those studies and highlighting the open issues and future research perspectives on the algorithm.},

The low voltage stresses on the power components make the converter more cost-effective compared to other high step-up DC-DC converters. Additionally, some of the semiconductor devices in the proposed converter operate under zero-current switching (ZCS), notably less lessening switching losses and improving general efficiency. Since three out of the four diodes turn off under ZCS conditions, reverse recovery losses are minimized. Furthermore, the topology requires only one gate driver, further reducing costs. Theoretical analyses have been conducted and validated using simulation results obtained from MATLAB/Simulink software.},

A novel model predictive control scheme is proposed that keeps the motor torque, the stator flux, and (if present) the inverter's neutral point potential within given hysteresis bounds while minimizing the switching frequency of the inverter. Based on an internal model of the drive, the controller predicts several future switch transitions, extrapolates the output trajectories, and chooses the sequence of inverter switch positions (voltage vectors) that minimizes the switching frequency. The advantages of the proposed controller are twofold. First, as underlined by the experimental results in the second part of this paper, it yields a superior performance with respect to the industrial state of the art. Specifically, the switching frequency is reduced by up to 50\% while the torque and flux are kept more accurately within their bounds. Moreover, the fast dynamic torque response is inherited from standard DTC. Second, the scheme is applicable to a large class of (three-phase) AC electric machines driven by inverters.},

The inverter switch positions are directly set by the controller thus avoiding the use of a modulator. Admissible switching sequences are enumerated and a state-space model of the drive is used to predict the drive's response to each sequence. The predicted short-term switching losses are evaluated and minimized. The concept of extrapolation and the use of bounds achieve an effective prediction horizon of up to 100 time-steps despite the short switching horizon. When compared to classic modulation schemes such as pulse width modulation, for long prediction horizons, the switching losses and/or the harmonic distortion of the current are almost halved when operating at low pulse numbers, thus effectively resembling the steady-state performance of optimized pulse patterns. During transients the dynamic response time of the proposed controller is in the range of a few ms and thus very fast.},

The proposed controller does not require any complex transformation or input voltage sensing. A detailed analysis of the distortions in the line and the neutral currents is presented. It is shown that the single-carrier-based, conventional sine-triangle PWM (CSPWM) scheme results in a peak-to-peak neutral current ripple, which is greater than the peak-to-peak ripple of any of the line currents. Also, for the same operating condition, the distortions in the line and the neutral currents increase considerably, when a three-limb boost inductor is used instead of three single-phase inductors. A three-carrier-based SPWM scheme is proposed in this paper. Compared to CSPWM, the proposed scheme significantly reduces the neutral current ripple when three single-phase inductors are used, and reduces both line and neutral current ripples when a three-limb inductor is used. The control scheme is verified through Matlab simulation. It is implemented on an field-programmable gate-array (FPGA)-based digital controller and tested on a prototype. Simulation and experimental results are presented.},

These filtering techniques can be broadly classified into in-loop and preloop filtering techniques depending on their position in the PLL structure. Inspired from the concept of delayed signal cancellation (DSC), the idea of cascaded DSC (CDSC) has recently been introduced as an effective solution to improve the performance of the PLL under adverse grid conditions. However, the focus has been on the application of CDSC operator as the prefiltering stage of PLL, and little work has been conducted on its application as the in-loop filtering stage of PLL. This paper provides a detailed analysis and design of dqCDSC-PLL (PLL with in-loop dq-frame CDSC operator). The study is started with an overview of this PLL. A systematic design method to fine tune its control parameters is then proposed. The performance of the dqCDSC-PLL under different grid scenarios is then evaluated in detail. It is then shown that how using the proportional-integral-derivative controller as the loop filter can improve the response time of dqCDSC-PLL. A detailed comparison between the dqCDSC-PLL and moving average filter (MAF) based PLL (MAF-PLL) is then carried out. Through a detailed mathematical analysis, it is also shown that these PLLs are equivalent under certain conditions. The suggested guidelines in this paper make designing the dqCDSC-PLL a simple and straightforward procedure. Besides, the analysis performed in this paper provides a useful insight for designers about the advantages/disadvantages of dqCDSC-PLL for their specific applications.},

  abstract = {This article presents a GPS-based decentralized control strategy for hybrid ac/dc microgrids. The proposed method uses V-I droop characteristics for the distributed energy resources (DERs) in each of ac and dc subgrids. In particular, the output voltage of each DER is adjusted as a piecewise linear function of the per-unit (pu) output current. In addition, a droop control method is proposed for the interlink converter (IC) to attain global power sharing among the dc and ac DERs. The IC controller changes the deviation of the ac bus voltage as a function of the deviation of the dc bus voltage. This way, the power flow between ac and dc subgrids is adjusted such that the ac and dc DERs experience the same pu voltage deviation and hence deliver the same pu current and active power. In contrast with the existing control approaches, the proposed method does not require frequency or power calculations but directly uses voltage and current measurements in the control loops. So the delay associated with the feedback signals is minimized, which avails accurate load sharing during transients. Experimental results show the proposed method eliminates the transient overshoots of DERs' output powers by offering a fast and overdamped dynamic response.},

  abstract = {Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) have achieved to enhance the flexibility of modern AC power systems, by providing fast, reliable and controllable solutions to steer the power flows and voltages in the network. The proliferation of High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission systems is leading to the opportunity of interconnecting several HVDC systems forming HVDC Supergrids. Such grids can eventually evolve to meshed systems which interconnect a number of different AC power systems and large scale offshore wind (or other renewable sources) power plants and clusters. While such heavily meshed systems can be considered futuristic and will not certainly happen in the near future, the sector is witnessing initial steps in this direction. In order to ensure the flexibility and controllability of meshed DC grids, the shunt connected AC-DC converters can be combined with additional simple and flexible DC-DC converters which can directly control current and power through the lines. The proposed DC-DC converters can provide a range of services to the HVDC grid, including power flow control capability, ancillary services for the HVDC grid or adjacent grids, stability improvement, oscillation damping, pole balancing and voltage control. The present paper presents relevant developments from industry and academia in the direction of the development of these converters, considering technical concepts, converter functionalities and possible integration with other existing systems. The paper explores a possible vision on the development of future meshed HVDC grids and discusses the role of the proposed converters in such grids.},

This analysis considers the influence of the system's voltage gain, the auxiliary dc/dc converter's efficiency, and the possibility of bidirectional power flow. Herein, the key PPP architectures are, thus, modeled and benchmarked. The presented results attest to the series configuration as the most efficient PPP circuit solution, with no limits on the system voltage gain, contrary to the generalized results found in today's literature. To assess these results and the significance of the proposed analysis, a well-known, simple, and cost-effective flyback topology has been designed and tested for a series PPP circuit solution able to effectively interface a 5-kW battery energy storage system (BESS) to a 700-V dc grid. A relatively high power conversion efficiency and compact hardware are achieved due to the reduced size requirements on the input and output filtering stages. Above all, while explaining the PPP concept, this study shows that even converter circuits known for their low power efficiency can be used to derive highly efficient systems. A design approach is, thus, provided to facilitate the design of the presented PPP circuit, and measurements are, finally, carried out to compare the obtained results with the expected ones derived from the developed analytical models.},

The results indicate its superiority to selected solutions based on back EMF integration (under assumption of no additional stator resistance identification algorithm). The performance of the DTC drive with ANN-based stator flux estimator has been compared to the analogous drives with PLPF (programmable low-pass filter)-based estimator and improved integration scheme with an amplitude limiter in polar coordinates.

In previous works, we presented possible advantages from using an artificial neural network (ANN) for speed control in a DTC-SVM (direct torque controlled-space vector modulated) drive. Learning of the neural controller was set on-line. Starting from a random configuration of the speed controller, the network adapts its weights according to an error criterion. Although the use of such specialized controller allows potential adaptive and robust control skills, tuning of an ANN for online learning control is a long iterative procedure. Indeed, optimization of the neural controller induces determination of ten parameters acting critically on the control dynamics. However, using optimization algorithms, one can reduce efforts to reveal this set of parameters. Several optimization algorithms are based on description of biological evolutions. We call such algorithms evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithm (GA) is a EA inspired by genetic processes leading human race toward optimal individuals capable of controlling their environment. This paper presents GA for optimization of ANN-based speed controller for induction motor drive.},

To narrow the frequency range for high efficiency, a Switched-Capacitor LLC (SC-LLC) topology is proposed by regulating the input voltage of LLC converter via a reconfigurable SC converter. To further improve efficiency, a hybrid structure with partial power processing characteristic is proposed for the SC. The proposed hybrid structure has advantages in terms of frequency range and power distribution compared to the cascaded and sigma structure. Finally, a 120W prototype is built to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. The peak efficiency reaches up to 95.5\% at the input of 36V and the output of 12V/10A. Moreover, an overall efficiency ranging from 93.7\% to 95.4\% at full load is achieved across the entire voltage range.

The control loops are devised and analyzed taking into account the special nature of a low voltage microgrid, in which the line impedance is mainly resistive and the distance between the inverters makes the control intercommunication between them difficult. In contrast with the conventional droop control method, the proposed controller uses resistive output impedance, and as a result a different control law is obtained. The controller is implemented by using a DSP board, which only uses local measurements of the unit, thus increasing the modularity, reliability, and flexibility of the distributed system. Experimental results are provided from two 6 kVA inverters connected in parallel, showing the features of the proposed wireless control},

In the last several years, efforts toward the standardization of these MGs have been made. In this sense, this paper presents the hierarchical control derived from ISA-95 and electrical dispatching standards to endow smartness and flexibility to MGs. The hierarchical control proposed consists of three levels: 1) The primary control is based on the droop method, including an output-impedance virtual loop; 2) the secondary control allows the restoration of the deviations produced by the primary control; and 3) the tertiary control manages the power flow between the MG and the external electrical distribution system. Results from a hierarchical-controlled MG are provided to show the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

The power sharing accuracy is highly sensitive to the output impedance of the inverters, making necessary the tight adjustment of this impedance.

  abstract = {Transformerless inverters, most of which are H-bridge inverters, have been widely used and studied in grid-connected power systems in the last decades. However, the H-bridge inverter is affected by the low- and high-frequency common-mode voltage between the input and output terminals, resulting in a large common-mode leakage current. An alternative solution is to connect the ground of the input terminal to the output load or grid, that is, the dual-grounded inverter. In this case, the low- and high-frequency common-mode voltages can be mitigated or eliminated. As a matter of fact, scholars have made several research results on dual-grounded inverters. However, as of now, there is still no literature that comprehensively and systematically summarizes these research results. To fill this gap, this article classifies different types of dual-grounded inverters from the perspective of topology for the first time, and compares and summarizes their advantages and disadvantages. More than 60 works of literature have been reviewed to identify the practical implementation challenges and research opportunities in the application of dual-grounded inverters.},

HDT can utilize the controllable capacity of the converter to achieve other functions while performing voltage conversion. One of the main functions of HDT is to solve the power quality problems of loads. The current power quality issues in the distribution system are reflected in the fact that the three phases are not completely identical. Therefore, the phase independent and controllable power quality management method is more suitable for the current distribution system. The phase separated independent controllable hybrid distribution transformer (SHDT) proposed in this article uses three single-phase converters to solve the power quality problems of each phase separately. Considering the different solutions to voltage and current issues, the mode switching switches are adopted to change the series parallel connection relationship of the converter, achieving two types of compensation functions while independently controlling the phase separation. Based on theoretical analysis, the function of phase independent compensation and the effect of mode switching were verified in the simulation platform.},

This creates a challenge for designing the interlink converter between the ac and dc subgrids, since the different modes require different interlink controls. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the concept of a transfverter inspired by how transformers link ac grids. Like a transformer, a transfverter can react to the presence of stiff voltage sources on either the dc or ac side and reflect the ``stiffness'' and voltage stabilizing capability to the other side. A back-to-back converter with droop control is used as the underlying technology to implement this concept. A novel optimization method called model bank synthesis is proposed to find control parameters for the interlink converter that offer the best controller performance across the different microgrid modes without requiring mode changing of the controller. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is validated through both simulation and experiments.},

The main challenge is to solve the power flow problem in hybrid microgrids while considering the absence of a slack bus and the coupling between the frequency and dc voltage. In the proposed algorithm, the ac power flow is solved using the Newton-Raphson (NR) method, thereby updating the ac variables and accordingly utilizing these variables in a proposed interlinking converter model for the dc problem. This sequential algorithm is iterated until convergence. The proposed algorithm is generic and can include different operational modes not only for the distributed generation units (DGs), but also for the interlinking converters. Detailed time-domain simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC have validated the algorithm's accuracy. Its robustness and computational cost are contrasted to those of conventional algorithms.},

  abstract = {With the growing demand for high-efficiency DC-DC converters with a wide input voltage range for wireless power transmission, four-switch boost converters (FSBBs) are attracting attention due to their low current stress and flexible mode switching characteristics. However, their complex operating modes and nonlinear dynamic characteristics lead to high switching losses and limited efficiency of the system under conventional control. In this paper, an optimization algorithm is combined with the multi-mode control of an FSBB converter for the first time, and a combined optimization and voltage closed-loop control strategy based on the Whale Migration Algorithm (WMA) is proposed. Under the four-mode operation conditions of the FSBB converter, the duty cycle and phase shift parameters of the switching devices are dynamically adjusted by optimizing the values to maximize the efficiency under different operation conditions, with the premise of achieving zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and the optimization objective of minimizing the inductor current as much as possible. Simulation results show that the proposed FSBB switching control strategy combined with the WMA algorithm improves the efficiency significantly over a wide voltage range (120--480 V) and under variable load conditions, and the transfer efficiency is improved by about 1.19\% compared with that of the traditional three-mode control, and the maximum transfer efficiency is 99.34\%, which verifies the validity and feasibility of the proposed strategy and provides a new approach to the high-efficiency control and application of FSBB converters.},

Optimal design of LC filter, controller parameters, and damping resistance is carried out in case of grid-connected mode. On the other hand, controller parameters and power sharing coefficients are optimized in case of autonomous mode. The control problem has been formulated as an optimization problem where particle swarm optimization is employed to search for optimal settings of the optimized parameters in each mode. In addition, nonlinear time-domain-based as well as eigenvalue-based objective functions are proposed to minimize the error in the measured power and to enhance the damping characteristics, respectively. Finally, the nonlinear time-domain simulation has been carried out to assess the effectiveness of the proposed controllers under different disturbances and loading conditions. The results show satisfactory performance with efficient damping characteristics of the microgrid considered in this study. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach for optimizing different parameters and its robustness have been confirmed through the eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear time-domain simulations.},

Other advantages include soft switching in the entire operating range and low current stress of semiconductor components even at very low series voltage. In addition, the proposed S-PPC provides protection and soft-start capabilities due to the integration of a solid-state circuit breaker.

An experimental prototype rated for 3.5 kW with maximum processed power of 600 W was built to confirm the converter operation principle and its features. Its experimental efficiency reaches 99.3\%.

Dynamic overmodulation characteristics of the modern triangle intersection PWM methods are modeled and shown to be unique for each method. The study reveals space-vector PWM (SVPWM) exhibits a minimum voltage magnitude error characteristic.

  abstract = {This paper addresses the resonance problem in a parallel-inverter-based grid-interactive microgrid. Unlike the single grid-connected inverter system where the resonance frequency is mainly fixed by the inverter output LCL filter parameters, the parallel-inverter-based grid-interactive microgrid system presents a more challenging picture where inverter interactions will excite complex resonances at various frequencies. As a result, line currents of inverters can be severely distorted even when the control schemes and filter circuits are properly designed based on the single-inverter model. This paper first develops a microgrid model using discrete time-domain closed-loop Norton's equivalent circuit. Multiple resonances can then be evaluated with the developed model. To improve the microgrid power quality, this paper also designs a virtual-harmonic-resistance-based active damping method. The proposed damping method can be seamlessly incorporated into the conventional deadbeat control scheme through the direct control reference modification. Therefore, the active damping method is able to address both the transient and steady-state resonances within the deadbeat current control bandwidth. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the correctness of the developed resonance modeling and active damping methods.},

The approach leads to the definition of single complex eigenvalues that do not have conjugate values associated with them. The use of complex state variables further permits the visualization of AC machine dynamics by complex signal flow graphs.

  abstract = {The proliferation of distributed energy resources is setting the stage for modern distribution systems to operate as microgrids, which can avoid power disruptions and serve as resources for fast recovery during macrogrid disturbances. Microgrids are, therefore, major assets to improve the grid resilience. However, the offered resilience is seriously undermined if microgrids are not properly protected in the event of faults within their own boundaries. Distribution protective devices cannot reliably protect microgrids due to the variable and often limited short-circuit capacities of microgrids. Moreover, the research on microgrid protection has not led to a commercially available microgrid relay to date and has little prospect of reaching that level in the near future. As a result, the existing options for reliable microgrid protection remain effectively the subtransmission and transmission system protective devices, e.g., directional overcurrent, distance, and differential relays. Although years of operation in macrogrids support these relays, their performance for microgrids is yet to be analyzed. This paper presents such analysis for different relay types by considering various fault and generation conditions in a microgrid.

  abstract = {Distributed generation (DG) is one of the key components of the emerging microgrid concept that enables renewable energy integration in a distribution network. In DG unit operation, inverters play a vital role in interfacing energy sources with the grid utility. An effective interfacing can successfully be accomplished by operating inverters with effective control techniques. This paper reviews and categorises different control methods (voltage and primary) for improving microgrid power quality, stability and power sharing approaches. In addition, the specific characteristics of microgrids are summarised to distinguish from distribution network control. Moreover, various control approaches including inner-loop controls and primary controls are compared according to their relative advantages and disadvantages. Finally, future research trends for microgrid control are discussed pointing out the research opportunities. This review paper will be a good basis for researchers working in microgrids and for industry to implement the ongoing research improvement in real systems.},

  abstract = {Over the ages, nature has constantly been a rich source of inspiration for science, with much still to discover about and learn from. Swarm Intelligence (SI), a major branch of artificial intelligence, was rendered to model the collective behavior of social swarms in nature. Ultimately, Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is arguably one of the most popular SI paradigms. Over the past two decades, PSO has been applied successfully, with good return as well, in a wide variety of fields of science and technology with a wider range of complex optimization problems, thereby occupying a prominent position in the optimization field. However, through indepth studies, a number of problems with the algorithm have been detected and identified; e.g., issues regarding convergence, diversity, and stability. Consequently, since its birth in the mid-1990s, PSO has witnessed a myriad of enhancements, extensions, and variants in various aspects of the algorithm, specifically after the twentieth century, and the related research has therefore now reached an impressive state. In this paper, a rigorous yet systematic review is presented to organize and summarize the information on the PSO algorithm and the developments and trends of its most basic as well as of some of the very notable implementations that have been introduced recently, bearing in mind the coverage of paradigm, theory, hybridization, parallelization, complex optimization, and the diverse applications of the algorithm, making it more accessible. Ease for researchers to determine which PSO variant is currently best suited or to be invented for a given optimization problem or application. This up-to-date review also highlights the current pressing issues and intriguing open challenges haunting PSO, prompting scholars and researchers to conduct further research both on the theory and application of the algorithm in the forthcoming years.},

  abstract = {As a reliable device for voltage regulation and isolation, a line frequency transformer is commonly connected in series with bidirectional converter (BIC) to interlink the ac and dc networks of hybrid ac/dc microgrid. However, it may not be suitable for the applications where weight and space occupation are of important concerns such as hybrid ac/dc microgrid. In this paper, bidirectional resonant dc transformer (BRDT) is proposed to replace the conventional bulky transformer for bus voltage matching and galvanic isolation. In order to simplify systematic coordination with BIC and central controller, BRDT is designed as an ideal transformer with simple openloop scheme. 50\% duty ratio scheme is implemented as it has been proven to be better than the phase-shift scheme in order to ensure BRDT conversion efficiency. A generalized model for various BRDT topologies, including CLLC, CLL, and LLC high frequency transformer (HFT), is established for analysis. The impacts induced by the transformer leakage, magnetizing inductances, and extra resonant capacitors are considered when designing the HFT. The conversion gain of the designed BRDT has also been analyzed in the full power range. Lab-scale prototypes for BRDT and hybrid ac/dc microgrid have been developed for experimental verifications. The performances of BRDT and system in both steady and transient states have been confirmed.},

In the hybrid ac/dc microgrid, the openloop control is always utilized by the CLLC-DCT to cooperate with the bidirectional interlinking converter to realize the power and voltage conversion between the ac and dc bus. This paper first studies the circuit parameters design of the open-loop controlled CLLC-DCT with consideration of such a realistic problem: The real inductors/capacitors values are actually different with their theoretically designed values due to the operation power and temperature variation. To solve this problem, a robust circuit parameters design scheme is proposed for the CLLC-DCT in this paper. With the proposed scheme, the designed CLLC-DCT exhibits good power transmission and voltage regulation ability in the hybrid ac/dc microgrid even when its actual inductors/capacitors values vary with the practical power and temperature. The robust design method is experimentally verified in a hybrid ac/dc microgrid prototype.},

This paper proposes an electromagnetic-electronic hybrid distribution transformer, which combines a traditional transformer and a partial power electronic converter to solve the problems of poor voltage regulation performance and voltage overrun of the traditional transformer. Meanwhile, this paper introduces its system theory, including the design method of multi-winding electromagnetic transformers and the topology and control structure of power electronic converters.

The input current ripple is decreased due to the interleaved operation and the voltage stress of the switches is only 1/6 of the output voltage when the turn ratio is 1. So the high-performance MOSFETs with low ON-state resistance can be used to reduce the conduction losses. The reverse-recovery problem of the output diode can be suppressed by the leakage inductance of the coupled inductors. The leakage inductance energy of the coupled inductors is absorbed and recycled to the output, which can largely improve the efficiency of the proposed converter. The working principle and steady-state characteristics of the converter are analyzed in detail. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified through experimental results of a 400-W laboratory prototype.},

  abstract = {The hybrid distribution transformer (HDT) achieves a compromise between the low-frequency transformer (LFT) and the solid-state transformer. It combines the LFT's efficiency and reliability with the added advantage of partial power controllability via an integrated converter. However, the existing research on the HDT fault ride-through does not consider the coordination relationship with its own safe operation constraints, while few studies have considered capacity coordination between multiple converters. Therefore, this article proposes an improved hierarchical coordination control of integrated HDT (IHDT), considering grid fault and normal conditions. First, the IHDT topology is proposed, and the operation mechanism of IHDT to realize the voltage support and current compensation is clarified by analyzing the coupling mechanism between the converter and LFT. Furthermore, under complex conditions, the unified expressions of the IHDT winding voltage, current, and power are derived, the safe operation constraints of IHDT are analyzed, and a hierarchical coordination control strategy is proposed. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the IHDT topology and control strategy are demonstrated by simulation analysis and experimental verification.},

Unfortunately, the corresponding training phase is a time-consuming and possibly money-consuming process, which needs to be repeated whenever application to a new plant system is requested. To reduce the total training time for a large set of heterogeneous plant systems, this article proposes a meta-reinforcement-learning-based approach that is to be utilized for the control of hundreds of different permanent magnet synchronous motor drives ranging from a few watts to hundreds of kilowatts. The so-called context variables carry the meta-information about the set of considered drive systems. Their estimation using a corresponding artificial neural network as context approximator is a core aspect of this article. The context information allows the reinforcement-learning-based control algorithm to automatically adapt itself to individual motor drives without requiring individual plant training. Since the found context variables can also be interpreted as an implicit system identification result, they allow us to determine irregular plant behavior (e.g., faulty drives) as an added bonus of the proposed meta-reinforcement learning scheme. Empirical results during this proof of concept successfully validate the potential of the proposed approach to drastically reduce the total training time and encourage further research.},

In this paper, we present a new formulation that results in a compact and sparse optimization problem to be solved at each sampling interval. The approach is based on a change of variables that leads to a block banded Hessian when the horizon length is bigger than the controllability index of the plant. In this case the problem can be solved with an interior-point method in time linear in the horizon length. Existing dense approaches grow cubically with the horizon length, whereas existing sparse approaches grow at a significantly greater rate than with the method presented here.},

The prime focus of the power management algorithm is to feed the ac loads, and dc loads from ac source, and photovoltaic battery energy storage (BES), respectively. The second objective is to utilize the solar power to maximum capacity, by feeding it to dc load, BES, and ac load, in the given order of priority. The ac and dc subgrids operate independently, while supporting each other in case of overloading/underloading, thus reducing the amount of power reserve required in each, and eliminating the need of dump loads. The ANFIS-MN-based power quality control is integrated in order to ensure the total harmonics distortion of ac source current remains below 5\% as per IEEE 519 standard, irrespective of the nature of load connected. In addition, the ILC control prevents any negative sequence currents from entering the ac source, even if there is any open circuit fault leading to unbalanced loading on the three phases. The performance of ANFIS-MN-based ILC control is demonstrated to be superior when compared with the conventional and contemporary techniques under different scenarios.},

The new control loop nonlinearity accomplishes this by interleaving a specified fraction of pass-through and nonpass-through switching periods.

Through adapting the effective switching frequency across the full range of conversion ratios and loads, reductions in loss up to 58\% are realized.},

The microgrid needs a high-performance controller to reduce the overshoot value that affects the efficiency of the network. However, the high voltage value causes the inverter to stop. Thus, an improved power-sharing response to the transfer between these two modes must be insured. More important points to study in a microgrid are the current sharing and power (active or reactive) sharing, besides the match percentage of power sharing among parallel inverters and the overshoot of both active and reactive power. This article aims to optimize the power response in addition to voltage and frequency stability, in order to make this network's performance more robust against external disturbance. This can be achieved through a self-tuning control method using an optimization algorithm. Here, the optimized droop control is provided by the H-infinity (H{$\infty$}) method improved with the artificial bee colony algorithm. To verify the results, it was compared with different algorithms such as conventional droop control, conventional particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony algorithms. The implementation of the optimization algorithm is explained using the time domain MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation model.},

  abstract = {For gas insulated switchgear (GIS), the loop resistance is a good indicator of the health status, which can be measured with dc voltage drop method. Usually, large dc current is demanded for the measurement due to the small loop resistance, and hence a bulky power electronics converter is needed. Aiming to obtain high power density and low cost, this paper proposes a partial power processing dc current source as a substitution for the conventional one. Because only part of the power is transferred through the converter and the rest is directly delivered from the input to the output, the power ratings of active/passive components are much decreased in the proposed scheme. Therefore, it is very attractive for the condition monitoring of GIS. In the paper, a practical partial power processing dc current source based on the current-fed full-bridge converter is firstly proposed. Afterwards, its operational principle, performance characteristics and design considerations are analyzed in detail to achieve a comprehensive understanding. Finally, the corresponding simulation results with 24V input and IOOOA output current are also demonstrated to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed solution.},

  abstract = {The microgrid concept is gaining widespread acceptance in near-term future power networks. Medium-voltage (MV) microgrids can be subjected to a high penetration level of dynamic loads [e.g., induction motor (IM) loads]. The highly nonlinear IM dynamics that couple active power, reactive power, voltage, and supply frequency dynamics challenge the stability of MV droop-controlled microgrids. However, detailed analysis and, more importantly, stabilization of MV microgrids with IM loads, are not reported in current literature. To fill in this gap, this paper presents integrated modeling, analysis, and stabilization of MV droop-controlled microgrids with IM load. A detailed small-signal model of a typical MV droop-controlled microgrid system, which is based on the IEEE Standard 399, with both dynamic and static loads is developed. The proposed model accounts for the impact of supply frequency dynamics associated with the droop-control scheme to accurately link the microgrid frequency dynamics to the motor dynamics. To stabilize the microgrid system in the presence of IM loads, a 2-degree-of-freedom active damping controller is proposed to stabilize the newly introduced oscillatory dynamics. The proposed supplementary active damping controller does not interfere with the steady-state performance, and yields robust control performance under a wide range of droop parameters and robust damping performance at small- and large-signal disturbances. A theoretical analysis, simulation, and experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

The discussion shows how current mode controls have alternative state feedback implementations, and describes unusual opportunities for large-signal control tuning. Considerations for minimum response time are described. Comparisons among tuning methods illustrate how geometric controls can achieve order of magnitude dynamic performance increases.

With mismatch, either the panel-integrated diodes are bypassing the shaded panels if the string is operated at the current level of the unshaded panels, or some power of the unshaded panels is lost if the string current is reduced to the level of the shaded panels. With the implementation of dc-dc converters on panel level, the maximum available power can be extracted from each panel regardless of any mismatch.

Proposed scheme is an extension of the augmented state feedback controller with multi-oscillatory terms. Multi-resonant controllers are well-established solution for this kind of converters if high quality output voltage is needed in the presence of nonlinear loads. They take advantage of repetitiveness of the control process under the steady load conditions (this includes nonlinear and unbalanced loads). No presumption on load type entails introduction of oscillatory terms for all three voltage components with resonant frequencies up to available bandwidth dictated by technically justified switching/sampling frequency. This makes the practical implementation challenging. Our idea is to reduce number of needed oscillatory terms by adding disturbance feedforward. In the discussed system the disturbance signal is easily accessible/measurable and hence this feedback can be very effective because of lack of estimation errors. The control system is designed in dq0 reference frame rotating with the fundamental output frequency. Extensive numerical experiments indicate that the number of oscillatory terms can be reduced significantly and high quality of output voltage can be maintained.},

Our main goal is to ensure high quality voltage waveform for unbalanced and nonlinear loads. An LQR approach was chosen. The LQR design approach has proven effective in many industrial applications. Although weights in a cost function are usually set by guess and check method, the LQR in proposed system gives satisfactory results as far as some general and very intuitive rules are applied, e.g. the penalty coefficient for an integral of control error is a few orders of magnitude away from penalty coefficients related to plant state variables. In order to immunise system against nonlinear loads oscillatory terms are included in the control scheme. They can be tuned for typical harmonics like 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th. A novelty of the proposed solution lies in the fact that all controller gains (including all integral and oscillatory terms) are determined altogether in one LQR procedure call. Controls are calculated in rotating reference frame. Simulation (continuous and discrete) and experimental results (at the level of 10kW) are included. They establish consistent set of tests that validates effectiveness of the design approach.},

The DC voltage controller is a PI-type, whereas the input current is shaped by a full-state feedback controller.

The discontinuity element is needed to provide a constant reference current signal during active power filtering operation.

  abstract = {This paper investigates (i) preplanned switching events and (ii) fault events that lead to islanding of a distribution subsystem and formation of a micro-grid. The micro-grid includes two distributed generation (DG) units. One unit is a conventional rotating synchronous machine and the other is interfaced through a power electronic converter. The interface converter of the latter unit is equipped with independent real and reactive power control to minimize islanding transients and maintain both angle stability and voltage quality within the micro-grid. The studies are performed based on a digital computer simulation approach using the PSCAD/EMTDC software package. The studies show that an appropriate control strategy for the power electronically interfaced DG unit can ensure stability of the micro-grid and maintain voltage quality at designated buses, even during islanding transients. This paper concludes that presence of an electronically-interfaced DG unit makes the concept of micro-grid a technically viable option for further investigations.},

The proposed SPO employs a flyback converter, which operates with the P\&O maximum power point tracking algorithm. The efficacy of these SPO systems is significantly improved, particularly under partial shading conditions, where centralized PV systems incur substantial losses. The performance of the 1 kW SPO system is evaluated in the presence of two different partial shading patterns and compared with the results of the centralized converter system. Simulation results show that the proposed SPO system has a tracking efficiency above 99.5 \%, enhancing the overall performance and making it a potentially viable solution for PV applications.},

The nonisolated topology is constructed by adding a small ac capacitor in parallel with the main inductor of the conventional buck-boost converter and replacing its semiconductor devices with the reverse-blocking switches. By using a novel control scheme, true zero-voltage switching is realized at both turn-on and turn-off of the power switches irrespective of the input voltage, output voltage, or load value. The isolated form of the converter is created by substituting the main inductor with an air-gapped high-frequency transformer, similar to the flyback converter. In this case, two smaller ac capacitors are placed on both sides of the transformer to realize soft switching as well as passive clamping; no extra clamping circuit is required. The basic operation of the proposed partial-resonant converters includes four modes and is described in detail. The comprehensive analysis of the topologies is carried out as well. Various experimental results in different operating conditions are provided to verify the performance of the proposed power converters.},

Model predictive control, as one of the subdivisions of this control method, has found a growing number of applications in power electronics and motor drives. In practical implementations, model predictive control faces performance degradation of the controlled plant due to its dependency on a model. There are considerable numbers of review papers that are devoted to the different points of view of predictive control. However, the existing literature lacks a review study that addresses the solutions for parameter dependency of the model predictive control method. Recently, model-free predictive control has been used in drives and power electronics as a solution for dealing with the model-dependency of the model predictive control method. There are many papers that have used such methods. In this paper, a classification is proposed for the different implementation types of model-free predictive control or similar methods that address model parameter uncertainties.

In Hybrid Microgrids (HMGs), AC and DC networks are interconnected with each other through power converters. Therefore, power converters play a very important role in HMG operation, as their functionality is not only limited to interconnection but also provides power flow control and improves the power quality through different ancillary services. Moreover, due to intermittency of Renewable Energy Resources (RESs), synchronization, load variation, availability of both AC and DC networks, etc., the controllability of the power converters, power management, and protection become very complex in HMG. This paper initially provides a comprehensive review of different interconnection methods and then presents an overview of different control strategies for HMG and Inter-Linking Converters (ILCs). Moreover, power management in different operating modes, including mode transition, is discussed in detail. This paper also provides a critical assessment of the available protection challenges of HMG and provide a comprehensive review of different available protection schemes and devices is provided.

HMGs have fewer power converters and are more flexible than pure ac and dc MGs, but the number of converters in HMG is still significant, especially when the dc part of HMG has several voltage levels. A new simplified and more flexible architecture for HMGs that features a new multiport interlinking converter (IC) is proposed in this article. Using the proposed IC, the number of power electronic converters in an HMG with several dc bus voltages can be reduced without increasing the number of active switches in the IC or the complexity of its control system. In this article, the new simplified HMG architecture is presented, and the operation of the proposed IC as a single unit and as a part of a simplified HMG are explained, along with its features. Experimental results obtained from a scaled-down prototype are also presented to confirm the feasibility of the multiport interlinking converter. Simulation results that show the effect of load variations in the intermediate bus architecture dc bus on the operation of the HMG are also presented as well.},

A push-pull converter is suitable for low-voltage photovoltaic ac module systems, because the step-up ratio of the high-frequency transformer is high, and the number of primary-side switches is relatively small. However, the conventional push-pull converter does not have high efficiency because of high-switching losses due to hard switching and transformer losses (copper and iron losses) as a result of the high turn ratio of the transformer. In the proposed converter, primary-side switches are turned ON at the zero-voltage switching condition and turned OFF at the zero-current switching condition through parallel resonance between the secondary leakage inductance of the transformer and a resonant capacitor. The proposed push-pull converter decreases the switching loss using soft switching of the primary switches. In addition, the turn ratio of the transformer can be reduced by half using a voltage-doubler of secondary side. The theoretical analysis of the proposed converter is verified by simulation and experimental results.},

Each local RMPC, based solely on local measurements, computes the optimal reactive power reference for its associated HDT. The optimization aims at correcting abnormal voltages and reducing reactive power injection/absorption. By doing so, this scheme achieves both objectives of ADN voltage regulation and control effort minimization. The salient feature of this scheme is that, by regarding the interactions among HDTs as disturbances and compensating them using tube-based robust method, it achieves a suboptimal control of ADN bus voltages without communication among HDTs. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

Alternatively, partial power dc--dc converters (PPCs) process only a portion of the full power to achieve MPPT. Other goals of PPCs are a higher efficiency, a higher power density, and a lower overall cost compared to FPCs (e.g., by using lower voltage class and/or lower current semiconductors). The flyback PPC topology shows that efficiency can be improved by 1\% in comparison to FPCs. However, the use of transformers with large self-inductance tends to increase the volume. An alternative architecture is proposed in this work based on a series resonant converter (SRC). The addition of this partial power SRC stage pays off in terms of current ripple mitigation, reduced volume, and high efficiency. The analysis and design of the proposed converter is presented in detail. The advantage of the proposed PPC architecture is highlighted by volume and loss comparisons.

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel isolated hybrid resonant converter with smooth transition between multiple operating modes. With the simple addition of a bidirectional ac switch, the highly-efficient series resonant converter operating in the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) is combined with a phase-shifted full-bridge buck converter and a pulse width modulated (PWM) boost converter in order to provide high power conversion efficiency over a wide input-voltage operating range utilizing a simple topology and simple control techniques. First, the topology is introduced and the converter's operating modes are discussed. Next, closed-loop input-voltage controllers are designed for the different operating modes and a smooth transition technique is introduced using a two-carrier modulation scheme. Experimental results are provided to verify the proposed system using a 300-W prototype that achieved a 97.5\% California Energy Commission (CEC) weighted efficiency with a 30-V input including all auxiliary and control losses.},

To enhance the fault ride-through (FRT) capability of DFIG and improve the converter capacity utilization, this paper proposes a novel DFIG-based WECS using a dynamic reconfiguration hybrid interlinking transformer (DR-HIT) technique for performance improvement under grid faults. Multiple operating modes and flexible switching strategies were developed based on the analysis of the proposed topology and principles. The proposed DR-HIT approach smooths the DFIG 's output power fluctuations through the cooperative control of the multifunctional converter (MFC) and grid-side converter (GSC) in shunt mode when the grid voltage is stable. Upon the occurrence of a grid voltage fault, the DR-HIT flexibly switches from shunt mode to series mode, maintaining the terminal voltage at a constant value. Additionally, once grid voltage recovers, the DR-HIT reverts flexibly to its shunt mode. Finally, simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve accurate control of the system and flexible switching between different modes.},

Such disruptions endanger the safe operation of the power system. This paper proposes a novel topology for DFIG-based WTG by integrating a hybrid interlinking transformer (HIT) and energy storage system. The proposed HIT-DFIG system consists of a grid-side converter, rotor-side converter, series converter (SEC), HIT, and direct current energy storage system (DC-ESS). The proposed HIT-DFIG actively adjusts the voltage of the series winding through SEC, achieving active support for the DFIG terminal voltage under grid fault conditions. The DC-ESS provides power support for HIT during the FRT period and has a power smoothing function. Subsequently, the operating principle, and mathematical modeling of HIT-DFIG are analyzed to demonstrate the function of series voltage regulation of HIT. Then, a simplified FRT control strategy is presented, purposed to enhance the low/high/harmonic voltages ride-through capability of DFIG during grid fault scenarios. Finally, the performance of the proposed HIT-DFIG, under diverse operating circumstances such as symmetric and asymmetric grid faults, was verified through simulation and experiments.},

Interior point method (IPM) and active set method (ASM) are the most commonly employed approaches for solving general QP problems. This paper compares several performance aspects of the two methods when they are implemented on a FPGA for MPC applications. We compare the computational complexity, storage, convergence speed, and some practical implementation issues. We find that, in general, ASM gives lower complexity and converges faster when the numbers of decision variables and constraints are small. Otherwise, IPM should be a better choice due to its scalability. We also note occasional instability of both IPM and ASM when they are implemented in our FPGA, which uses single precision floating point arithmetic. The instability is mainly due to numerical error, which is found to be more serious in ASM than IPM in our current implementations.},

The calculation of P-Q droop coefficients is based on the voltage sensitivity value derived by Jacobian matrix. To achieve the desired P-Q droop coefficient, it is necessary to reflect active power-frequency (P-f) and reactive power-voltage magnitude (Q-V) droop scheme widely used in an islanded microgrid. The P-f droop characteristic is applied by regarding the renewable generator as a slack bus and the Q-V droop characteristic is applied by adding the additional term to Jacobian matrix.

The high voltage gain can be achieved by the SC networks without an extremely large duty cycle, and the voltage stresses of all the active switches and diodes are kept at levels much lower than the output voltage. Compared with the traditional SC converters, the proposed converter can achieve continuous voltage regulation by the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) technique. The interleaving operation can reduce the input current ripple and improve the power capacity. Resonant inductors with small inductances are inserted into the SC networks to avoid the high current spikes that occur in the traditional SC converters. All the active switches can achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS) turn-on. Some of the diodes can achieve zero-current switching (ZCS) turn-off, and the other diodes achieve reduced turn-off di/dt rates. The operating principle and essential steady-state characteristics of the converter are analyzed in detail. Finally, a prototype converter with an input voltage of 25-40 V, an output voltage of 400 V, and a rated power of 1 kW is designed and implemented to verify the theoretical analysis.},

However, existing full feedforward strategies are complex and control delay cannot be compensated precisely, which leads to the instability of system when the full feedforward of the voltage at the point of common coupling under the weak grid is adopted. This article first proposes a simplified full feedforward strategy based on grid-side inductor volt-age differential feedback active damping (GIVD-AD). Second, repetitive prediction (RP) is used to compensate for the control delay. Then, a virtual impedance branch is added and an adaptive algorithm for modifying virtual impedance based on the difference between predicted grid voltages by Newton interpolation prediction (NIP) and RP is proposed. With the proposed method, grid-connected inverters can work stably when grid impedance changes suddenly and exhibit strong rejection ability against grid-voltage harmonics. Finally, simulative and experimental results from a 3-kW single-phase grid-connected inverter are provided to prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

Moreover, another concern raised from the applications of direct model predictive current control is the computational burden, especially for the long-horizon implementations. Therefore, a dual reference frame solution for the surface permanent-magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM) is proposed in this article to allocate a great proportion of heavy computations required for the optimization problem to the offline preparation, which can reduce the computational burden by almost 50\% on average for a prediction horizon of five time-steps. Besides, the parameter mismatch effects of individual electrical parameters on the control performance of the model predictive direct current control method are investigated and quantified via simulations. A five-step direct model predictive current control is implemented on a dSPACE system with a sampling frequency of 20 kHz to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with an SPMSM drive system.},

It is proposed that two inverters connected in shunt and series are used for each distributed generation (DG) system in the microgrid. In each inverter, both positive- and negative-sequence components are controlled to compensate for the effects caused by the unbalanced utility grid voltages. Specifically, the shunt inverter is controlled to ensure balanced voltages within the microgrid and to regulate power dispatches among parallel-connected DG systems, while the series inverter balances the line currents by injecting appropriate voltage components. A current-limiting algorithm is also proposed and integrated within the inverter control schemes to protect the microgrid from large fault currents during utility voltage sags. The proposed compensator has been tested in simulations and experimentally using a laboratory hardware prototype.},

In order to maximize the development of distribution substations, this paper proposes a high-frequency isolated hybrid distribution transformer, which has functions of comprehensive power quality control and AC/DC hybrid distribution, and can meet the high-quality power supply and friendly connection requirements of new sources/load for distribution terminal users. Firstly, the topology structure of the high-frequency isolated hybrid distribution transformer is introduced and the mathematical model is derived. Then, based on the characteristics of the topology structure, continuous-set model predictive control (CCS-MPC) strategy and delayed MPC control strategy are designed to calculate the optimal duty cycle and achieve output with fixed switching frequency and switching sequence, reducing the optimization computation. Finally, a 10kV/0.4kV full power level high-frequency isolated hybrid distribution transformer system is built using MATLAB/Simulink simulation software to verify the effectiveness of the proposed topology structure in comprehensive power quality control.},

To improve the parameter robustness of MPCC, a model-free current predictive control method that combines ultra-local model and sliding mode observer is proposed. First, the prediction model of MPCC based on the mathematical model of surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM) is replaced by the ultra-local model that does not use any motor parameters. Second, the sliding mode observer is adopted to observe the parameter of ultra-local model and compensate parameter disturbance. Finally, the stability of the sliding mode observer is proved by the Lyapunov stability criterion. The traditional MPCC method and the proposed model-free current predictive control method are comparatively analyzed, simulation and experimental results show that the proposed model-free current predictive control method can improve the parameter robustness of MPCC.},

  abstract = {Car-following control is a fundamental application of autonomous driving. This control has multiple objectives, including tracking a safe distance to a preceding vehicle and enhancing driving comfort. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful method due to its intuitiveness and capability to cover multiple objectives. MPC determines the relative importance of objectives through a set of weight factors, depending on which, the controller's behavior changes even if the traffic situations are the same. However, determining the optimal weight is not a trivial problem because there is no benchmark to evaluate the performance of the weight, and searching for weight factors with repeated driving experiments is time-consuming. To solve this problem, we proposed an automatic tuning method to determine the weights of the MPC based on personal driving data. Personal driving data under naturalistic driving conditions provide car-following situations and driver's behaviors. These data can generate a reference model to represent the driver's driving style. Based on this model, the proposed method defined the automatic tuning problem as an optimization problem that minimizes the difference between the reference and the controller's response using the optimal weight factors. This optimization problem was solved using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The proposed method was implemented with an embedded optimization coder in an offline fashion. Its performance was evaluated using personal driving data. From this, the proposed method can reduce the effort and time required for an engineer to find the optimal weight factors.},

The Four-Switch Buck--Boost converter has gained widespread application due to its wide voltage conversion range, consistent input and output polarity, and the capability of bidirectional power transfer. This paper focuses on the energy conversion requirements in high-voltage scenarios for electric vehicles, analyzing the working principle of this converter and typical control strategies. It summarizes the issues encountered under different control strategies and presents improvements. Hard-switching multi-mode control strategies aim to improve control algorithms and logic to mitigate large duty cycle variations and voltage gain discontinuities caused by dead zones. For control strategies based on controlling the inductor current to achieve soft-switching, the discussion mainly focuses on optimizing the implementation of soft-switching, reducing overall system losses, and improving the computation speed. Finally, the paper summarizes FSBB control strategies and outlines future directions, providing theoretical support for high-voltage fast charging and onboard power supplies in electric vehicles.},

In this paper, the droop control equations adopted by the distributed sources connected to the AC sub-microgrid and the DC sub-microgrid is analyzed in detail. Furthermore, a bidirectional droop control strategy for interlinking converters based on PI control is proposed to realize the power balance of isolated hybrid microgrids. This strategy considers the characteristics of interlinking converters that need to maintain AC bus frequency and DC bus voltage stability and power bidirectional transmission. Mutual power support between AC and DC subsystems can reduce the impact of the deviation of the individual subsystem from the rated operating conditions on the remaining subsystems. Finally, a simulation model of the AC/DC hybrid microgrid is built in MATLAB/Simulink to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

A new research trend in the residential generation system is to employ the PV parallel-connected configuration rather than the series-connected configuration to satisfy the safety requirements and to make full use of the PV generated power. How to achieve high-step-up, low-cost, and high-efficiency dc/dc conversion is the major consideration due to the low PV output voltage with the parallel-connected structure. The limitations of the conventional boost converters in these applications are analyzed. Then, most of the topologies with high-step-up, low-cost, and high-efficiency performance are covered and classified into several categories. The advantages and disadvantages of these converters are discussed. Furthermore, a general conceptual circuit for high-step-up, low-cost, and high-efficiency dc/dc conversion is proposed to derive the next-generation topologies for the PV grid-connected power system. Finally, the major challenges of high-step-up, low-cost, and high-efficiency dc/dc converters are summarized.

In this control scheme, two compound controllers are established to regulate the grid current and load voltage, respectively.

However, when both input and output voltage ranges are wide, the three-dimensional (3-D) look-up table (LUT) with huge data quantity or the switching frequency with wide variation range is typically required in previous schemes.

Only with a 2-D LUT in a small range of input and output voltage, rms inductor current can be minimized. Moreover, the switching frequency is constant with the proposed scheme. In addition, ZVS conditions, which are accurate and simple, are derived to facilitate the minimization of rms inductor current.

  abstract = {This paper presents a multifunctional control system for interlinking converters interfacing microgrids and ac mains. Applicable standards pose power quality and grid-support function requirements for converters that interface energy resources of dc nature with an ac utility grid. At the same time, the forthcoming smart grid scenario calls for additional functionalities, enabling the effective integration of hybrid (i.e., dc or ac) microgrids, that are applicable to both grid-connected and islanded modes of operation. This requires novel interlinking converter controllers with extended flexibility. The control system described in this paper fulfills both connected and islanded operation needs and provides seamless transitions between the two modes. Such valuable functionalities are attained owing to an underlying, large-bandwidth, triple-loop control organization. The target converter is meant to be connected to a local dc subgrid at the dc side and to a local ac subgrid at the ac side. The controller manages the connection of the ac-side subgrid with the utility grid, ensuring a fast response control of the ac grid current. Therefore, it allows interfacing of renewable sources and loads, aggregated in dc and ac nanogrids or microgrids, with smart power systems, providing enhanced power quality, stability, and flexibility of operation.},

There are two degrees of modulation freedom in the PCCM ZVS modulation scheme. The previous schemes typically only optimize one of them to reduce root mean square (rms) inductor current, which results in relatively lower efficiency in the condition when the difference between input voltage and output voltage is large. In this article, a multi-frequency PCCM ZVS modulation scheme is proposed for the FSBB converter with wide input and output voltage ranges. By optimizing both of the two degrees of modulation freedom to reduce rms inductor current, the heavy-load efficiency can be effectively improved when the difference between input voltage and output voltage is large. Thus, the overall efficiency of the FSBB converter can be optimized. A 1500-W FSBB prototype with input and output voltage ranges of 200--400V is built to verify the proposed modulation scheme.},

In this paper, the model of the LCL filter and the design criteria of the LCL filter for a shunt active power filter (SAPF) are analyzed in the beginning. Then, the impacts of all parameters of the LCL filter on SAPF are intuitively drawn on a graph by theoretical derivation.

  abstract = {The partial power processing (PPP) concept has been extensively employed in many two-port converters to achieve high efficiency and high-power density by modifying one of the original converter ports to be connected in series between input and output. This is attractive but is confined to two-port applications, and how to extend it to multiport applications is not clear. Hence, this article aims to explore a generalized PPP multiport scheme by arranging the connection of the module rather than the converter. For a PPP single-input(output)-N-outputs(inputs) converter, one terminal of all N+1 modules is connected together to construct a radial structure, and another terminal is series/parallel connected with the input/output port. Each module only needs to process partial power caused by the voltage or current difference between input and output. Therefore, the required power rating of components is effectively reduced, contributing to low cost as well as low power loss. In this article, a PPP single-input dual-output converter with active bridge modules is also taken as an example to be introduced in detail, designed and experimented upon, which validates that high efficiency and high-power density can be achieved.},

  abstract = {The general two-port partial power processing (PPP) dc-dc converters can only realize voltage step-up or step-down because the polarity of the voltage difference is fixed by the conversion module. This is adverse for its introduction into buck-boost applications. Previous authors have realised buck-boost conversion by adding extra switches to make the conversion module bi-polar. Nevertheless, when the output voltage changes between buck and boost, the voltage gain of the conversion modules is required to have a wide range, which can result in a large degradation of the conversion performance. To avoid polarity reversal and a wide voltage gain range of the conversion module, we propose a novel PPP buck-boost dc-dc converter with a T-shaped module connection. Each branch of the T is equipped with one conversion module. By regulating the middle module voltage, whenever the output voltage changes, the voltage gains can be limited to a relatively narrow range, ensuring high performance. In this paper, the triple active bridge is chosen for the conversion modules. The corresponding analysis and simulation results will be demonstrated based on an example application of 350V input to 320V-380V output.},

In GFM plants implemented by multiple virtual synchronous generators (VSGs), these performance aspects are dominated by VSGs' active power control (APC) parameters, i.e., the inertia constant H and damping coefficient D. However, an APC parameter design with these performance aspects comprehensively considered remains unexplored, potentially leading to inappropriate P-f droop, underdamped LFOs, or excessive APST bandwidth. To address this issue, first, by separating the multi-VSG system's active power responses into a common part and a differential part, the analytical expressions for its LFO damping ratio and APST bandwidth are derived. Second, by aligning these performance aspects with the requirements outlined in representative GFM plant guidelines, a systematic APC parameter design method is proposed. This method explicitly formulates the feasible region for the APC parameters that ensures appropriate P-f droop, LFO damping, and APST bandwidth. Finally, real-time simulations and experiments are conducted in various multi-VSG systems to validate the theoretical analysis and the proposed APC parameter design method.},

Modeling analysis indicates that, during the uncontrolled rectification stage, the unbypassed soft-start strategy allows both the series and shunt converters of the HDT to charge their dc-link capacitors simultaneously, maintaining approximately fixed current ratio and voltage ratio. In the pulsewidth modulation rectification stage, sequentially enabling the closed-loop control of shunt and series converters allows the dc-link capacitors to be further charged to their rated voltage. The key innovation lies in the slight delay enablement of the series converter and the PI parameters-varying control, which can effectively suppress the inrush current owing to the weak controllability of the shunt converter and the windings voltage change during the switchover period. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed unbypassed soft-start strategy, whether using constant or ramped dc-link voltage references.},

The series resonant converter is suitable to be utilized as an active voltage regulator, due to its ability to operate with soft switching, and hence, with high efficiency. In discontinuous conduction mode, the series resonant converter operates with a constant unity voltage gain, thus achieving balancing of the DC link. However, discontinuous conduction mode does not provide means for achieving a different voltage distribution, which is important in many scenarios. On the other hand, by operating in quantum mode (i.e. type 2 discontinuous conduction mode), the voltages across DC bus capacitor can be regulated. Therefore, the modeling of the quantum mode series resonant converter connected across split DC bus is presented in this paper. The steady-state operation as well as transient behavior are discussed and experimentally verified on a laboratory prototype.},

  abstract = {High-voltage gain converters with differential connection have gained popularity. However, some hypotheses are imposed to achieve these topologies, such as the converters must be mirrored, among others. This fact makes the converters symmetrical and they have two or more switches. To demonstrate that this connection structure allows new combinations, in this article a new single switch and asymmetric topology is proposed based on the differential connection. This topology is based on a boost converter with a coupled inductor and a voltage multiplier cell. Even with a low number of components, the proposed converter has high-voltage gain, the components present low voltage and current stress. To demonstrate that the converter has good performance, two prototypes were built considering different values of the duty cycle and turns ratio of coupled inductor. From there, the maximum efficiency achieved is 97.5\% at 200 W.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) is an optimization-based strategy for high-performance control that is attracting increasing interest. While MPC requires the online solution of an optimization problem, its ability to handle multivariable systems and constraints makes it a very powerful control strategy specially for MPC of embedded systems, which have an ever increasing amount of sensing and computation capabilities. We argue that the implementation of MPC on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) using automatic tools is nowadays possible, achieving cost-effective successful applications on fast or resource-constrained systems. The main burden for the implementation of MPC on FPGAs is the challenging design of the necessary algorithms. We outline an approach to achieve a software-supported optimized implementation of MPC on FPGAs using high-level synthesis tools and automatic code generation. The proposed strategy exploits the arithmetic operations necessaries to solve optimization problems to tailor an FPGA design, which allows a tradeoff between energy, memory requirements, cost, and achievable speed. We show the capabilities and the simplicity of use of the proposed methodology on two different examples and illustrate its advantages over a microcontroller implementation.},

For a given minimum ON-time and, consequently, for a given minimum duty ratio D/sub min/, D/sup 2/ in the numerator of M(D) yields a much lower limit on the minimum attainable conversion ratio. By applying a systematic synthesis procedure, six novel single-transistor converter configurations with quadratic DC conversion ratios are found. The simpler, single-transistor realization is the most important advantage over the straightforward cascade of two basic converters. As far as conversion efficiency is concerned, it is clear that a single-stage converter is usually a better choice than a two-stage converter. The quadratic converters proposed are intended for applications where conventional single-stage converters are inadequate-for high-frequency applications where the specified range of input voltages and the specified range of output voltages call for an extremely large range of conversion ratios.{$<>$}},

By integrating LFTs with power converters, HDTs enhance the operational capabilities of the system. The specific configuration in which converters are connected to the transformer allows for the provision of multiple services. This can not only prevent network failures but also extend the lifespan of its components, an outcome that is highly desirable in a distribution grid. This article discusses an HDT developed to mitigate voltage fluctuations in the grid and to decrease the reactive power drawn from the secondary side of traditional LFTs. A finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC), in conjunction with linear controllers, is utilized for the effective management of the HDT converters. Two separate control loops are established to regulate voltage and reactive power on the secondary side of the transformer. Results from Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing affirm the proficiency of HDT in reducing grid voltage variations by 15\% and in cutting reactive power consumption by up to 94\%. The adopted control strategy and topology are demonstrated to be effective in stabilizing voltage and reactive power fluctuations while concurrently facilitating the charging of the converters' DC link directly from the grid.},

Coordinating distributed generators (DGs) is complex, so communication-based controllers are proliferating in the literature. Then, this work proposes a distributed control strategy for islanded ac/dc multi-MGs interconnected by interlinking converters (ILCs). The proposed scheme is implemented in the ILCs and consists of distributed controllers that equalize global generation costs, allowing secondary control in each MG. Control actions that safeguard the saturated operation of MGs and ILCs are included in the control designs. The simultaneous operation with multiple objectives is possible due to adjusting control parameters according to a prioritization criterion. Experiments are conducted through an extensive simulated environment. The results show the proposed multiobjective controllers could maintain global optimal costs during normal operation while not overloading DGs, ILCs, subgrids, and clusters of ILCs. Furthermore, the strategy may reduce operational costs in the long term by protecting the lifetime of critical MG components. Desynchronization of incremental costs is enforced at 15\% at most under demanding conditions. Also, it is possible to operate against considerable ({$>$}250 [ms]) time delays in the tests.},

This feature makes the converter suitable for applications with a wide input voltage range. The range of the dc gain is increased by the implementation of the combined energy transfer principle. A reconfigurable structure is used to combine the energy transfer by the isolation transformer and the coupled inductor of the impedance-source network. The adaptive mode change activates the energy transfer via an additional winding in the qZS network at lower voltages, which results in considerable efficiency improvement. Consequently, the input voltage range of the converter is extended to the values useful in photovoltaic applications impacted by partial shading. The proposed approach is verified in a photovoltaic (PV) microconverter, where the energy harvest from a PV module is possible during shading by enabling the global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT). It is demonstrated that the dual-mode operation of the converter helps to achieve a flat efficiency curve along with outstanding maximum power point tracking (MPPT) performance.},

  abstract = {A digital control technique for the inverter stage of uninterruptible power supplies is proposed, which is based on a predictive regulator on both output voltage and inductor current. Its aim is to achieve a deadbeat dynamic response for the controlled variables (output voltage and inverter current). Besides the linear state feedback which allocates system poles at the origin so as to achieve deadbeat response for all state variables, the use of a disturbance observer for the estimation of the load current and of any other source of errors (such as dead-times, parameter, and model mismatches) is investigated. The proposed solution is able to guarantee a fast dynamic response and also a precise compensation of any source of unpredictable disturbance. Moreover, with a proper design of observer parameters, it is possible to reduce control sensitivity to model uncertainties, parameter mismatches, and noise on sensed variables, which usually characterizes existing deadbeat control techniques. Finally, the control algorithm is quite simple and requires only the measurements of the output voltage and inductor current. Experimental results on a single-phase 2 kVA prototype show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Furthermore the simple dual integrator based architecture of a SOGI filter facilitates frequency adaptation, for example as is used in motor drive applications. However a consequence of this simple architecture is that the digital form of the SOGI filter is highly susceptible to discretization errors which can compromise the converter steady state tracking accuracy. This paper now presents an alternative state-space approach to realise accurate discrete SOGI filters using Hold and Tustin (pre-warp) methods. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been verified using simulation and experimental investigations of an inverter interfaced to a distorted grid and controlled using multiple harmonic SOGI filters.},

However, the complex structure and control dynamics of hybrid AC and DC MGs challenge their operational stability, especially when compared to individual AC or DC MGs. This paper develops a holistic small-signal model of autonomous hybrid AC and DC MGs, which incorporates AC and DC sections as well as interface converters between AC and DC buses. The small-signal stability of the developed model is analyzed to derive a stability region. In particular, a 2-D stability region is defined using flexible cross-domain parameter combinations from either control systems or main power circuits of hybrid AC and DC systems. Further, an artificial intelligence (AI)-aided support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is employed to estimate the stability region boundary (SRB), which provides a computationally efficient way to visualize the stable operation region. Leveraging the real-time hardware-in-the-loop (RT-HIL) platform, case studies conducted on a test hybrid system with five converters (two DC-AC inverters, two DC-DC converters, and one interlink converter) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed work. Multi-fold cross-validation of all the case studies confirms that the out-of-sample misclassification rate meets the required threshold of 5\%.},

However, the wide and overlapping voltage ranges of the battery and the fuel cell require an interconnecting bidirectional DC-DC converter with buck-boost capability. For such a converter system, the gravimetric power density is a key metric. Therefore, this paper systematically investigates the weight limits of several converter topology concepts: Starting from a standard two-level four-switch non-inverting buck-boost converter benchmark system, fully soft-switched operation, as well as flying-capacitor multilevel and partial-power-processing variants are compared by means of a comprehensive Pareto optimization (mission-profile efficiency vs. gravimetric power density). Aiming at a mission profile efficiency of {\textbackslash}boldsymbol{\o}verline{\textbackslash}eta {$>$} 98.5 \%, the results indicate the feasibility of converter realizations with gravimetric power densities of up to {\textbackslash}gamma {$>$} 62{\textbackslash}textkW/ kg with a three-level flying capacitor multilevel converter.

  abstract = {The article proposes a ground-breaking solution to address the challenge of imposing constraints in a full state feedback (FSF) control system. Its simplicity is comparable to the introduction of saturation blocks in the cascaded control system. In the developed control system, a given state variable is stabilized at the threshold value using a separate FSF controller. The overall controller consists then of a set of controllers, the main one with an external reference signal and auxiliary controllers with the internal references set to the desired limits to be imposed on each of the physical states of the investigated plant, operating in parallel fashion (hence the proposed name-multithreaded). This means that in each time instance, the processor executes all FSF controllers. Additionally, if the auxiliary integral states are implemented, a back-calculation algorithm is employed to keep the auxiliary states at the desired level for the controllers that are idling at a given time instance. The median of the calculated control signals is put through to the plant as a control signal. Such an elegant and straightforward way of handling constraints in the state feedback system has never been reported before and is currently patent pending. The proposed method is validated for a servo drive using hardware-in-the-loop setup. All the obtained results confirm technical feasibility of the controller structure and its ability to keep all the state variables within the required intervals.},

The method combines the versatility and high-quality control offered by the state-feedback controllers for linear plants with the ease of imposing limits on the controlled variables offered by the cascaded control systems. The method is groundbreaking in its ability to bridge the gap between the elegance of the full-state-feedback control structure and its lack of popularity among power electronics engineers and possibly also other groups of practitioners. A multithreaded state controller is proposed in the form of three state controllers: one to control grid currents and dc-link voltage if limits of the currents are not reached, and two state controllers that are put into the closed loop if one of the current limits is reached. A complete design procedure is proposed, including the selection of all gains present in the three state-feedback controllers using the pole placement method. An algorithm of soft switching between the three control signals is also developed. Sharing the desired dynamics between the threads is fulfilled thanks to the eigenstructure assignment introduced to overcome the problem of multiple solutions by choosing the most orthogonal eigenvectors. The proposed control system is then verified in a simulation, and its high practicality is demonstrated experimentally.},

Due to non-linearities within battery chemistries and due to charge/discharge effects, two sets of batteries can no longer be considered identical. Additionally, actual batteries have extremely strict safety requirements that have to be fulfilled.

  abstract = {The dynamics and performance of low-inertia ac grids with frequency support (e.g., droop and virtual inertia controls) have been investigated thoroughly. Recently, the dc grid concept has been considered a cost-effective and efficient option in modern power distribution systems, where one of its most valuable applications is to support the frequency and voltage of low-inertia and weak grids. However, the literature does not fully address a comprehensive stability analysis and performance assessment of a low-inertia system supported by a dc grid. Therefore, this paper presents a thorough yet straightforward dc-side impedance-based stability analysis of a low-inertia ac grid connected to a dc grid via a bidirectional voltage-source converter (VSC) equipped with a virtual inertia controller to improve the ac grid frequency behavior. In the proposed virtual inertia control, low-pass and high-pass filter implementations are investigated, and their performance is compared. The dc-side equivalent impedance models are developed for the 1) interlinking VSC combined with its ac grid, considering virtual inertia control and typical ac grid components: synchronous generators (with their turbine, governer, and exciter models), induction motor loads, and static loads, and 2) dc grid considering its practical components: distributed generators, constant-power loads, and resistive loads. Therefore, unlike previous methods, the proposed impedance modeling and stability analysis approach considers the impacts of the ac grid frequency/voltage dynamics and dc grid dynamics on the VSC dc-bus stability. Impedance interactions are characterized and used to assess the overall system dynamics and stability and the impacts of the system and control parameters.

Depending on the application, the converters used for grid connection are built using one or two conversion stages. The advantages of the converters with a DC-stage are mainly the distributed maximum power point tracking algorithm per PV string, a wider range of operation, higher energy yield and, when required for grid connection, the possibility of voltage regulation. However, the conversion efficiency is lower than configurations with a single stage as the central inverter. Therefore, the proposed work presents a Partial Power DC-DC converter (PPC) which process part of the entire system power, and the surplus power is directly supplied to the output side.

Power networks are undergoing a transition from the traditional model of centralised generation towards a smart decentralised network of renewable sources and ES systems, organised into autonomous microgrids. ES systems can provide a range of services, particularly when distributed throughout the power network. The introduction of distributed ES represents a fundamental change for power networks, increasing the network control problem dimensionality and adding long time-scale dynamics associated with the storage systems' state of charge levels. Managing microgrids with many small distributed ES systems requires new scalable control strategies that are robust to power network and communication network disturbances. This paper reviews the range of services distributed ES systems can provide, and the control challenges they introduce. The focus of this paper is a presentation of the latest decentralised, centralised and distributed multi-agent control strategies designed to coordinate distributed microgrid ES systems. Finally, multi-agent control with agents satisfying Wooldridge's definition of intelligence is proposed as a promising direction for future research.},

  abstract = {In conventional photovoltaic (PV)-battery systems, a centralized battery storage system (BSS) is typically connected through a separate bidirectional converter at the common dc link to support the PV system. It is known that a bidirectional converter typically requires more switches than a unidirectional converter, and hence, a complete PV-battery power interface will result in a high-cost system and will suffer high power losses. This paper proposed an integrated battery storage interface with soft-switching capability for module-integrated PV systems. In the proposed system, a multi-input converter (MIC) structure that consists of an integrated soft-switched quasi-resonant (QR) Cuk- and flyback-based circuit is presented. In this approach, the battery charging circuit is integrated with the input side of the PV power optimizer while the battery discharging circuit of the proposed system shares the output filter of the PV power optimizer, resulting in a compact and efficient system. The proposed converter is capable of tracking the maximum power point (MPP) and following the charging profile (constant voltage and constant current) of the battery. Moreover, all the switches in the proposed converter are able to achieve soft-switched turn on and turn off for different operating conditions. The operating principles and the theoretical analysis of the proposed system are presented. Experimental results on a 175-W proof-of-concept prototype are presented to demonstrate the features of the proposed converter.},

  abstract = {Traditional methods of determining steady-state power system operating points are not applicable to droop-controlled microgrids. The conditions of an islanded microgrid, including the absence of a slack bus and inherent coupling of complex power, frequency, and bus voltage, require new tools to properly analyze. In this study, a method of determining the operating points of droop-controlled microgrids is proposed. The procedure is similar in form and function to a traditional power flow analysis, but is performed in the synchronous reference frame to ensure compatibility with conventional inverter models. A quasi-Newton iterative process is used to solve the nonlinear equations pertaining to each generation unit and load bus. The method provides a structured approach to determining the consistent system-level linearization points required for large-scale microgrid studies. Grid-forming, grid-feeding, and grid-supporting generation units are supported, along with both constant impedance and constant power loads. The method is validated in hardware experiments, simulations, and comparisons to results of existing power flow algorithms. As an example of the method's potential applications, a procedure for determining droop constants that ensure equal Q sharing between generation units is constructed around the proposed method's basic functionality.},

In this paper, a new reconfigurable Full-bridge-based PPC is proposed. The reconfigurable scheme allows to take advantage of both step-up PPC of Type I, and step-down PPC of Type II. In order to enlarge the operation range, the proposed converter can also be reconfigured as a classical full-power converter.

  abstract = {The defossilization of industrial processes is currently one of the main efforts at stopping the climate crisis. In particular, the beer industry has been looking at electrifying its heat-dependent processes to reduce its carbon footprint. Yet, current solutions are typically tailored for large-scale breweries leaving microbreweries, due to a larger relative cost, to use gas as primary resource, which makes it difficult to control the process temperature. To ensure a fine temperature control, thus avoid malt's stress, a dc-powered heating element can be used. Yet, the cost of this solution is still not suitable for microbreweries. In this paper, we propose the use of a reconfigurable partial-power converter that allows to increase the overall power rating while maximizing its efficiency, together with a full-bridge rectifier that controls the dc-link voltage and ensures low harmonic-content. The simulation results show that the control scheme is capable of reconfiguring the partial-power converter to seamlessly transition between a flyback mode to a step-down partial-power converter mode only when full heating power is needed, thus allowing to shrink the cost of the overall system.},

  abstract = {Hybrid microgrids (HMGs) are more flexible and require fewer power converters than ac and dc microgrids (MGs); however, the number of wires/buses in HMGs is still considerable, especially when there are multiple voltage levels in the dc subgrid. There are five wires/buses in conventional singlephase ac/bipolar dc (BDC) HMGs, two (phase and neutral) in the ac subgrid, and three (positive, zero, and negative) in the BDC subgrid. This article presents a new four-wire architecture with a common zero and neutral bus for a single-phase ac/BDC HMG that features a new bidirectional interlinking converter (IC). Using the proposed structure, the number of wires/buses and total costs are reduced without increasing the number of IC switches or complicating its control method. Besides, the common zero and neutral bus in the proposed structure provides proper grounding for both subgrids, reduces leakage current ({$\approx$}0 mA), and improves fault tolerability in dc fault conditions. For this purpose, the dc-side fault ride-through (FRT) capabilities of the conventional and proposed ICs are compared by driving their mathematical models under dc fault conditions. The most severe currents experienced by conventional IC switches in a resistive grounded system are 760 A under positive and 1300 A under negative and zero terminal-to-ground (ZG) fault conditions. However, the proposed IC does not experience any overcurrent in ZG fault conditions, and its switches' current stresses are reduced to 170 A for positive and 320 A for negative terminalto-ground fault conditions. To validate the performance of the proposed IC and its modulation technique, simulation results in PSCAD/EMTDC environment and experimental results based on a scaled-down prototype are presented.},

  abstract = {A hybrid microgrid (MG) combines both AC and DC MGs using a bidirectional interlinking converter (IC). In a hybrid MG, grounding both the AC and DC MGs is done using isolated converters or low-frequency transformers. However, low-frequency transformers complicate the converter design, and high-frequency transformers reduce efficiency. Consequently, non-isolated ICs are often preferred in hybrid MGs. The grounding of non-isolated hybrid MGs is a complex issue that requires ongoing research and attention. Comprehensive knowledge of the available AC and DC MG grounding strategies and their effects is essential for designing, operating, and protecting the hybrid MGs. This paper develops a holistic grounding strategy for hybrid MGs, which incorporates AC and DC sections as well as ICs between AC and DC buses. Line-to-ground (LG) fault detection and protection, service continuity, common mode voltage, leakage current levels, system reliability, transient LG fault current magnitude, personnel/equipment safety, and insulation requirements are thoroughly examined by comparing different grounding strategies.},

  abstract = {A hybrid microgrid is an interconnected system of an AC and DC subgrid using an interlinking converter (IC). The main concerns for the stable operation of a hybrid microgrid are primarily related to the control of the DG, ICs, and loads. The small perturbation instability associated with the stability of the control loops affects the performance of the IC. The linearized model of the IC has the cross-coupling of axes d and q that adds to the effective impedance at the output side of the filter section. This needs to be addressed, as it affects the power-sharing capability of the IC. In this work, structural decoupling is directly derived from the linearized state-space model. It ensures a mathematically rigorous decoupling strategy that is precisely aligned with the system's dynamics, ensuring a more accurate and effective control framework and offering a more scalable framework for decoupling. Unlike conventional d-q decoupling strategies, which rely on empirical separation of the control loops in a rotating frame, this decoupling approach based on the linearized state-space model of the interlinking converter is less complex and a perfect decoupled is obtained. MATLAB simulation results and the experimental results are also verified.},

Interlinking AC/DC converter is the key of this topology which has the following characteristics: being able to provide two equal pole voltages in DC side; complying with the standards of current quality at AC side; being able to control active and reactive power independently in AC side, and transmitting bidirectional power. In this paper, two categories of power converters including single-stage and two-stage converters are proposed for this topology. A new cost-effective control strategy is added to the control of general grid-connected converter for each interlinking converter, and the control of autonomous DC-link pole voltage for both candidates is achieved. Detailed simulations based on the designed control strategies are conducted to validate the function of control strategies under the operation conditions of different DC sides. The performances of two selected interlinking converters with balanced and unbalanced DC loads are analyzed. Suggested power quality of microgrid and total harmonic distortion (THD) analysis are demonstrated in grid-tied and islanded modes. Eventually, semiconductor power loss simulations based on a closed-loop thermal network simulation are conducted. Thereby, the mutual effects of power loss and initial junction temperature are investigated.},

To allow a high penetration of renewable energies, provide an increased system reliability during islanding and reduce the dependency on the mains, Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) are included in both the DC and AC grids. The MG is composed by DC grid, with connection to the mains and a central battery ESS, and a flexible number of AC subgrids coupled to the DC bus through AC/DC 3-phase Interlinking Converters. The paper presents three main contributions: 1) A DC bus regulation scheme is proposed based on DC virtual generators and P/V DC droop that allows to adapt the participation in the power sharing for DC bus regulation and provides with an automatic transition between grid-connected and islanding modes; 2) In order to provide a cooperative operation between the different AC subgrids, allowing the automatic power sharing between them through the DC bus, a Hybrid AC/DC Virtual Generator control scheme is proposed based on the Virtual Synchronous Generator concept, for its implementation in the interlinking converters; 3) an AC voltage and frequency compensator suitable for systems with high resistive line impedance. The discussion is supported with small signal analysis, simulations and Hardware-in-the-loop.},

  abstract = {Hybrid AC/DC microgrids (H-MGs) are a prominent solution for integrating distributed generation and modern AC and DC loads. However, controlling these systems is challenging as multiple electrical variables need to be controlled and coordinated. To provide flexibility to the control system, these variables can be regulated to specific values or within secure bands. This paper proposes a set of distributed model predictive control schemes for the secondary control level to control certain variables to specific values and other variables within secure pre-defined bands into H-MGs. Specifically, optimal dispatch of active and reactive power is achieved while frequency and voltages are regulated within secure bands in H-MGs. Dynamic models of AC generators, DC generators and interlinking converters along with their novel multi-objective cost functions are developed in constrained distributed predictive optimisation problems to simultaneously achieve the aforementioned objectives via information sharing. Extensive simulation work validates the performance of this proposal.},

  abstract = {This article introduces an innovative parallel differential power processing (PDPP) architecture designed to mitigate the effect of mismatch among photovoltaic (PV) strings. The proposed PV to virtual bus PDPP architecture leverages a virtual bus as the input for all string-level converters. Notably, this approach allows for a reduction in the voltage rating of components since the virtual bus voltage can be set lower than the main bus or PV strings voltage. In this architecture, crucial requirements for the string-level converters (SLCs) include the capability to generate positive and negative output voltages and to provide isolation. To fulfill these requirements, a dual active bridge converter connected to a bridgeless converter as the PDPP SLCs is considered. In this architecture, while SLCs ensure maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for each PV string using conventional MPPT algorithms, the central converter controls the virtual bus voltage. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed PV to virtual bus PDPP architecture with a system efficiency ranging from 96.4\% to 99\%.},

Rather than applying variable frequency control to the resonant converter, which would result in reactive power processing and a more complicated electromagnetic compatibility filter design, the converter remains in its optimal operating point all time and an additional partial-power (PP) processing auxiliary converter is used to tightly regulate the output voltage. The PP converter, supplied through a tertiary winding of the resonant converter's transformer, regulates the output by adding or subtracting voltage from the dc input and has only a marginal impact on the overall efficiency of the dc-dc converter. The principal of operation is explained in detail including Sankey diagrams to illustrate the power processing of the converter and a feedback control system is proposed to tightly regulate the 48 V output voltage. A hardware demonstrator rated at 1.5 kW is implemented to cope with input voltage variations between 340 and 420 V and experimental results are provided showing that the output voltage can be kept within {\textpm}1\% of the nominal 48 V even under harsh input voltage and load transients. The realized dc-dc converter with PP pre-regulation features an overall efficiency of 97.7\% at rated power and a power density of 8.6 kWdm-3 (141w/3 in).},

A controller based on reinforcement learning was developed and evaluated in comparison to traditional proportional-integral controllers in dynamic and faultprone environments. The results illustrate the superior adaptability, stability, and optimization potential of the reinforcement learning approach, particularly in addressing dynamic disturbances and ensuring robust performance. The study illustrates how reinforcement learning can facilitate the transition from conceptual design to implementation by automating optimization processes, enabling interface automation, and enhancing system-level testing. Based on the aforementioned findings, this paper presents future directions for research, which include the integration of domain-specific knowledge into the reinforcement learning process and the validation of this process in realworld environments.

The objective of designing a controller for the car suspension system is to improve the ride comfort while maintaining the constraints on to the suspension travel and tire deformation subjected to different road profile. However, due to the mismatched uncertainty in the mathematical model of the ASS, sliding mode control (SMC) cannot be applied directly to control the system. Thus, the purpose of this work is to adapt the SMC technique for the control of ASS, where particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to design the sliding surface such that the effect of the mismatched uncertainty can be minimized. The performance of the proposed sliding mode controller based on the PSO algorithm is compared with the linear quadratic optimal control (LQR) and the existing passive suspension system. In comparison with the other control methods, the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed controller, where it significantly improved the ride comfort 67\% and 25\% more than the passive suspension system and the LQR controller, respectively.{\^A}},

Also, there must be a constant adaptation due to the continuous variation of power production. Control techniques for Power Converters like the MPPT algorithm (Maximum Power Point Tracking) present very good results on photovoltaic chains. Nevertheless, losses on power elements reduce global performance and the voltage/current adaptation is not always possible. In this paper, the use of the high efficiency structure Four Switch Buck-Boost for Photovoltaic systems is addressed. FSBB Converters present some advantages regarding other Power Converter structures: it has few electrical components, output voltage can be higher or lower than input voltage, and it presents a non-inverted output voltage as happens with others Buck-Boost Converters. A prototype of FSBB has been developed in order to exploit these new capabilities for a Photovoltaic DC-DC power application (solar module: 0V to 20V input voltage and different resistive loads). The implemented MPPT digital control chooses between a Buck or Boost mode, depending on the working conditions. Firstly, an introduction and the FSBB operating mode are addressed. Then, the adaptive MPPT control algorithm is detailed. And finally, the experimental results and conclusion are presented.},

A planar magnetic is a low-profile transformer or inductor utilizing planar windings, instead of the traditional windings made of Cu wires. In this paper, the most important factors for planar transformer (PT) design including winding loss, core loss, leakage inductance, and stray capacitance have individually been investigated. The tradeoffs among these factors have to be analyzed in order to achieve optimal parameters. Combined with an application, four typical winding arrangements have been compared to illustrate their advantages and disadvantages. An improved interleaving structure with optimal behaviors is proposed, which constructs the top layer paralleling with the bottom layer and then in series with the other turns of the primary, so that a lower magnetomotive force ratio m can be obtained, as well as minimized ac resistance, leakage inductance, and even stray capacitance. A 1.2-kW full-bridge dc--dc converter prototype employing the improved PT structure has been constructed, over 96\% efficiency is achieved, and a 2.7\% improvement, compared with the noninterleaving structure, is obtained.},

For systems with a number of measured variables (p) greater than the number of manipulated variables (m), it is clear that any controller can track without offset at most m controlled variables. One may think that m integrating disturbances are sufficient to guarantee offset-free control in the m controlled variables. We show this idea is incorrect and present general conditions that allow zero steady-state offset. In particular, a number of integrating disturbances equal to the number of measured variables are shown to be sufficient to guarantee zero offset in the controlled variables.

  abstract = {In this paper we have proposed a new diversity guided particle swarm optimizer (PSO), namely ATRE-PSO, which is a modification of attractive and repulsive PSO (ARPSO), suggested by Riget and Vesterstorm [1]. Depending on the diversity of the population the ATRE-PSO switches alternately between three phases of attraction, repulsion and a combination of attraction and repulsion, called the phase of positive conflict [2]. The performance of ATRE-PSO is compared with basic PSO (BPSO) and ARPSO. The numerical results show that besides preserving the rapid convergence of the BPSO, ATRE-PSO also maintains a good diversity in the population. Under most of the test cases, simulations show that ATRE-PSO finds a better solution than BPSO as well as ARPSO.},

The MPDTC scheme is designed to keep the motor torque and stator flux and the inverter's neutral point potential within given hysteresis bounds while reducing the average switching frequency of the inverter, in comparison with the standard direct torque control (DTC) method. The algorithm is embedded in the control software environment of ABB's ACS6000 medium-voltage drive, and experimental results are provided which verify the advantageous features of MPDTC in terms of average inverter switching frequency reduction. More specifically, compared to standard DTC, the proposed MPDTC scheme achieves an average (over the whole operating range) reduction of the inverter switching frequency of 16.5\%, but for specific operating conditions the reduction is as much as 37.4\%.},

While many active damping methods have been proposed to overcome this issue, the role that pulse width modulation transport delay plays in the effectiveness of these strategies is still not fully resolved. This paper presents a theoretical discrete time-analysis framework that identifies three distinct regions of LCL filter resonance, namely, a high resonant frequency region where active damping is not required, a critical resonant frequency where a controller cannot stabilize the system, and a low resonant frequency region where active damping is essential. Suitable controllers are then proposed for the two stable regions, with gain calculations that allow for the greatest system bandwidth and damping. Simulation and experimental results verify the presented analysis.},

This is computationally expensive and becomes a limitation to embed and use MPC in plants with fast sampling rates. Several special solvers for MPC problems have been proposed in the last years, but most of them focus on state-space formulations, which are very popular in academia. This paper proposes a solution based on alternated direction method of multipliers, tailored for embedded systems and applied to generalized predictive control (GPC), which is a very popular formulation in industry. Implementations issues of parallel computation are discussed in order to accelerate the time required for the operations. The implementation in an FPGA proved to be quite fast, with the observed worst case execution time of 11,54 {\textmu}s for the presented example. These results contribute to embed GPC applications in processes that are typically controlled by classical controllers because of their fast dynamics.},

The focus of past research has been with making the PSO method more complex, as this is frequently believed to increase its adaptability to other optimization problems. This study takes the opposite approach and simplifies the PSO method. To compare the efficacy of the original PSO and the simplified variant here, an easy technique is presented for efficiently tuning their behavioural parameters. The technique works by employing an overlaid meta-optimizer, which is capable of simultaneously tuning parameters with regard to multiple optimization problems, whereas previous approaches to meta-optimization have tuned behavioural parameters to work well on just a single optimization problem. It is then found that not only the PSO method and its simplified variant have comparable performance for optimizing a number of Artificial Neural Network problems, but also the simplified variant appears to offer a small improvement in some cases.},

These operational requirements must be satisfied with respect to the converter safety and physical limitations, such as the limited magnitude of the converter output current and terminal voltage. In this paper, all the control requirements mentioned above are taken into account in a single constrained optimization problem using the framework of Model-based Predictive Control (MPC). Solving the primary control problem in this way allows the microgrid to respond to major disturbances such short-circuit faults and transitions between modes of operation, while the electronically-interfaced DER units operate within operational and safety limits.},

  abstract = {The control law of electronically-interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) must be able to maintain the stability and voltage regulation of the host microgrid in the two modes of operation. Ideally, this should be achieved by a decentralized primary control strategy that is independent of any communication infrastructure in order to increase the resilience of the microgrid. This is challenging as the primary control objectives in islanded and grid-connected modes of operation are conflicting. This paper proposes a decentralized control law for DER units based on state feedback and disturbance rejection. The controller provides an integral action which enables output current reference tracking. An ad-hoc partial input saturation technique is also proposed in order to prevent the integral action from having an adverse impact on the voltage amplitude and frequency regulation in the islanded mode of operation. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated via a time-domain simulation of a medium-voltage distribution network with three embedded DER units, as well as through an experimental three-bus microgrid with two DER units. The results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed control strategy to transitions between the modes of operation and other network topological changes.},

To that end, the interaction of each distributed energy resource unit within the microgrid is modeled as a lumped dynamic system, which results to be nonlinear and multivariable. For the closed-loop control of such multivariable systems, the full state feedback formulation is preferred which requires a suitable state observer. For the design of the observer and feedback gains, the solution of the linear-quadratic estimation and regulation problems is considered. For simplicity, an approximate linear model at a representative operating point is derived. The linear quadratic Gaussian/loop-transfer recovery is adopted as the design procedure to optimize the trajectory of the state variables subject to a desirable actuation effort, in this case of the voltage amplitude and frequency, yielding a solution that is robust to model uncertainties. The effectiveness of the strategy is assessed through time-domain simulation on the CIGRE benchmark medium-voltage distribution network with three distributed energy resource units. These results are compared to those obtained with conventional static droop gains and with a state-of-the-art technique from the literature.},

The proposed converter is capable of supplying a voltage range from 200 V to 1000 V at its output, which shows the feasibility of occupying the converter inside a charging station that allows charging 400 V and 800 V battery systems. The average efficiency reported is over 97\%. It is concluded that the proposed buck-boost FC converter is suitable for modern wide-output EV fast charging applications.},

  abstract = {This work introduces a reconfigurable topology for AC-link partial power converters (PPC), intended for use as high-frequency transformerless regulated DC-DC converters in fast charging stations for electric vehicles (EV). This new topology allows an AC-link PPC to be reconfigured so that it works as a type I PPC during boost mode and as a type II PPC during buck mode. The converter is able to operate across a wide output voltage range, making it compatible with the different battery voltage configurations found in the electric vehicle industry. The converter is reconfigured using four additional switches. Depending on the operating mode, these switches can be turned on or off to achieve the desired topology. In a type I PPC configuration, the input is connected in parallel, and the output is connected in series with the battery. In a type II configuration, the input is connected in series, and the output is connected in parallel with the battery. This paper presents an analysis of converter operations and control for EV charging systems operating at 400 V and 800 V, incorporating both operation validation and efficiency metrics derived from simulations.},

An LCL-filter is a third-order low-pass filter, which is commonly used with PWM rectifiers and inverters. When properly designed, an LCL-filter offers a much better suppression of the switching frequency current ripple than a simple inductor. However, there are many matters to consider when designing an LCL-filter. The wide control bandwidth of active power filters makes the design of an LCL-filter even more challenging. This paper studies the suitability of an LCL-filter for four-wire active power filter topologies, presents an example LCL-filter structure and discusses matters related to design and accurate modeling of an LCL-filter. Finally, the proposed LCL-filter structure is applied to two common voltage source shunt four-wire active power filter topologies and the performance of the systems is verified by computer simulations and experimental tests.},

However, due to the effect of line resistances, these approaches may create a circulating power as well as overstressing the ICs in the case of employing multiple ICs for interconnecting the ac and dc subgrids. This paper proposes an autonomous power sharing approach for hybrid microgrids interconnected through multiple ICs by introducing a superimposed frequency in the dc subgrid. Hence, a suitable droop approach is presented to manage the power among the dc and ac sources as well as ICs. The outcomes are proportional power sharing, preventing circulating power and overstressing the ICs as well as acceptable dc voltage regulation. Furthermore, the maximum transferred power by the ICs can be improved by employing the proposed approach. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated by simulation.},

In this context, a new interlink hybrid converter is presented in this paper. This solution is designed to interlink AC grids and bipolar DC microgrids or two DC microgrids. The simplest solution allows linking a three-phase AC grid using only two single-phase inverters. However, it can be extended with the purpose to make a multilevel converter. The solution allows to transfer the energy in a way that supports the attenuation of the voltage unbalance that can appear in the DC microgrid(s). This support is done by an independent transference of energy to the microgrid poles or microgrids. This concept and behavior of the interlink hybrid converter will be tested through simulation studies. The results obtained in these studies show the capability of the proposed solution.},

  abstract = {The analysis of the small-signal stability of conventional power systems is well established, but for inverter based microgrids there is a need to establish how circuit and control features give rise to particular oscillatory modes and which of these have poor damping. This paper develops the modeling and analysis of autonomous operation of inverter-based microgrids. Each sub-module is modeled in state-space form and all are combined together on a common reference frame. The model captures the detail of the control loops of the inverter but not the switching action. Some inverter modes are found at relatively high frequency and so a full dynamic model of the network (rather than an algebraic impedance model) is used. The complete model is linearized around an operating point and the resulting system matrix is used to derive the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues (termed ``modes'') indicate the frequency and damping of oscillatory components in the transient response. A sensitivity analysis is also presented which helps identifying the origin of each of the modes and identify possible feedback signals for design of controllers to improve the system stability. With experience it is possible to simplify the model (reduce the order) if particular modes are not of interest as is the case with synchronous machine models. Experimental results from a microgrid of three 10-kW inverters are used to verify the results obtained from the model.},

This poses new challenges for distribution network operators, including voltage fluctuations beyond permissible limits that can differ in different parts of the same distribution network. The Hybrid Transformer (HT) is an effective solution that can mitigate voltage fluctuations continuously, dynamically and in a local manner, through combining a standard distribution transformer with a power electronic converter. In this paper a retrofittable HT topology is proposed. It utilises a second, fractionally-rated line frequency transformer (LFT) to enable the use of low-voltage power electronics with low power ratings for reduced costs and complexity. The proposed topology is modelled and a scaled hardware prototype is used to verify theory and simulation results. The simulation and experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed topology, its applicability to mitigate voltage fluctuations, and its benefits over alternative approaches.},

However, a bipolar dc microgrid (BDCMG) demands multiple conventional dc-dc converters to feed power to both the poles of the BDCMG. To handle this requirement and to maintain high efficiency, a new four-port, dual-input-dual-output dc-dc converter topology is proposed for interfacing the solar photovoltaic (PV) and fuel cell sources to a low-voltage BDCMG. The proposed topology is unidirectional, efficient, and compact. It has fewer circuit elements with only one inductor compared to the conventional nonisolated dc-dc converters. The proposed converter regulates one of the pole voltages of the dc bus and also ensures maximum power point tracking of the PV source. Furthermore, the converter can be operated as a single-input-dual-output converter. The control complexity of the proposed converter is low as it can be operated in various modes with only one set of controllers. To design the control system for the proposed converter, a small-signal model is derived for each operating mode. Loss modeling and efficiency analysis of the proposed converter are carried out, and its efficacy and performance are validated by detailed simulation and experimental results under various operating conditions.},

Unlike the conventional efficiency improvement methods, which is based on cumbersome circuit/component optimization and/or modification for a single operating point, this paper proposes a simple approach based on topology transition which can achieve a high efficiency for a wide input voltage range. In particular, the topology of the LED driver can change between buck, boost, and buck-boost converter according to the level of the input voltage. In addition, a novel current mode controller is proposed, such that 1) compatibility to different topologies, 2) seamless topology transition, and 3) fast current reference tracking can be concurrently achieved. The feasibilities of the proposed topology transition method and its control has been experimentally verified through a four-switch buck-boost converter prototype with 7-45 V input, 25 V/1 A LED strings output. It is shown that there is more than 5\% efficiency improvement as compared to the conventional four-switch buck-boost converter. Full range (0\%-100\%) and precise (1\% dimming precision) pulse-width-modulated dimming has also been demonstrated.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses about the partial power processing concept applied to DC/DC converters, which has been presented in the literature as an option to be used on voltage regulators in several applications such as photovoltaic systems. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the partial power processing concept and demonstrate that, opposing the sense created in the literature, the fact that a converter performs partial active power processing does not necessarily means that their efficiency and/or power density will be higher than that of a standard converter that processes full active power. It is shown that the performance of DC/DC converter depends not only on its active power, but also on nonactive power that flows inside the converter and the nonactive power drained from source and/or supplied to the load. To demonstrate it, the nonactive power is evaluated on a partial active power buck-boost converter and a new approach is proposed to quantify the total power handled by a DC/DC power converter. Experimental results are presented in order to confirm the analysis.},

  abstract = {The purpose of controlling the vehicle handling is to ensure that the vehicle is in a safe condition and following its desire path. Vehicle yaw rate is controlled in order to achieve a good vehicle handling. In this paper, the optimal Composite Nonlinear Feedback (CNF) control technique is proposed for an Active Front Steering (AFS) system for improving the vehicle yaw rate response. The model used in order to validate the performance of controller is nonlinear vehicle model with 7 degree-of-freedom (DOF) and a bicycle model is implemented for the purpose of designing the controller. In designing an optimal CNF controller, the parameter estimation of linear and nonlinear gain becomes very important to produce the best output response. An intelligent algorithm is designed to minimize the time consumed to get the best parameter. To design an optimal method, Multi Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) is utilized to optimize the CNF controller performance. As a result, transient performance of the yaw rate has improved with the increased speed of in tracking and searching of the best optimized parameter estimation for the linear and the nonlinear gain of CNF controller.{\^A}~{\^A}},

  abstract = {Due to the easy accessibility of highly efficient PV panels that minimize negative environmental effects, solar photovoltaic (PV) power systems are presently used as a significant alternative power source. The household PV power plants in use are often linked together in strings or arrays before being in a grid-connected state or a load using an inverter. The research is done with the PV plant, which comprises six panels, each having a 250 Wp rating, linked in series to produce 1.5 kWp of rated power and then connected to the load through an inverter. A multiple PWM approach is employed in this system to regulate an inverter's switches. The system's main flaw is that it suffers a production loss of roughly 60\% if any external elements, such a chimney or a tree, cast any shade onto one or more panels. In the proposed system, a cascaded boost converter with sliding mode control is designed to match the PV panel's source and load characteristics even while it is being shadowed by outside influences. The MATLAB/SIMULINK environment is used to model the proposed system. The system is linked to the load after the system's output from the cascaded boost converter roughly 30 V DC which is connected in series with the other five panels to create a string of 180 V DC. Using an LM318 comparator, a boost converter with sliding mode control is realized. The converter's output ranges from 28 to 30 volts. As a result, the entire system power is increased by around 30\%.},

All the input sources used are of different levels to operate the converter at imitated mismatched voltage conditions and partial shading conditions, which is a dominant problem observed while integrating distinct SPV modules. As the description of converter functions, operation at different states is presented. The converter is operated in open loop configuration to ensure converter capability under SPV applications.

In addition, the usual complex product vdqi{$\ast$}dq for power evaluation in the dqo coordinates does not exhibit reactive power consistency with the IEEE standard but for the balanced case. Such consistency becomes a central issue in the context of distributed generation systems since they are often subject to voltage/current imbalance, and the active power, the reactive power, and the power factor are important control variables and, as such, require calculation and measurement. This study provides a complete set of phasor-based analytical expressions (including the instantaneous, active, reactive, complex and apparent powers) in dqo coordinates which help stability and control developments of unbalanced distributed generation systems.

  abstract = {Partial power converters, also know as fractional or differential power converters among other terminologies, is a very attractive concept that has gained an increasing attention during the last decades. Through a rearrangement of the traditional power conversion structures, the converter only processes a fraction of the total power while the rest is directly transmitted to the load. Consequently, a significant reduction in size and cost of the converter is achieved through the use of low-power ratings devices, allowing also higher efficiencies. Partial power converters have been proposed for various applications, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems. In PV applications single-phase grid-connected PV inverter are composed usually by two-stage power conversion, a full power DC-DC converter and a hard-switched high frequency PWM inverter. Although, different DC-DC partial power converter have been proposed as a first stage, most of the existing solutions deals with constant DC-DC regulation voltage, then the DC-AC grid tied inverter stage still requires to perform all the inversion through hard-switched PWM strategy. In this paper a partial power unfolding dc-dc stage is proposed, which generates a rectified sinusoidal current, leaving only the unfolding duty to the inverter stage. As a result, only one hard-switched PWM partial power stage composes the system, increasing the efficiency. The proposed partial power inverter is applied on a 3.3kW PV string inverter. Simulation results are provide to verify the interest of the proposed partial power DC-AC inverter.},

As a multivariable and strong coupling nonlinear system, the controller design of the three phase PWM converter, either the classical PID control method or the nonlinear control method, involves the time consuming controller parameters tuning problem. It is even worse that the improperly adjusted controller parameters might damage the system. In this paper, the particle swarm optimization is proposed to optimize the control parameters of the double closed loop PI controllers. To deal with this multi-parameter multi-objective optimization problem, we combine the PSO algorithm with the Pareto optimal solution theory to optimize the PI control parameters.

Although there is an extensive amount of literature available describing LCL filters, there has been a gap in providing a systematic design methodology.

  abstract = {The enabling of ac microgrids in distribution networks allows delivering distributed power and providing grid support services during regular operation of the grid, as well as powering isolated islands in case of faults and contingencies, thus increasing the performance and reliability of the electrical system. The high penetration of distributed generators, linked to the grid through highly controllable power processors based on power electronics, together with the incorporation of electrical energy storage systems, communication technologies, and controllable loads, opens new horizons to the effective expansion of microgrid applications integrated into electrical power systems. This paper carries out an overview about microgrid structures and control techniques at different hierarchical levels. At the power converter level, a detailed analysis of the main operation modes and control structures for power converters belonging to microgrids is carried out, focusing mainly on grid-forming, grid-feeding, and grid-supporting configurations. This analysis is extended as well toward the hierarchical control scheme of microgrids, which, based on the primary, secondary, and tertiary control layer division, is devoted to minimize the operation cost, coordinating support services, meanwhile maximizing the reliability and the controllability of microgrids. Finally, the main grid services that microgrids can offer to the main network, as well as the future trends in the development of their operation and control for the next future, are presented and discussed.},

Each topic presented in this work is thoroughly discussed and reviewed, analyzing characteristics, implementation issues, and reported advantages and disadvantages to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research and future challenges in four-leg converters.

PPC allows the converter to process only a fraction of the total power, the rest being bypassed and directly supplied to the load. This increases the converter efficiency, as only a portion of the power goes through the converter, thus increasing its efficiency. The principle of operation of the proposed PPC is theoretically analyzed. Simulations of the behavior of the proposed PPC are provided for the charging of an EV battery. Results show the good behavior of the proposed system. It is in particular verified that the proposed converter only process a fraction of the power around 36\% for the entire output power range.

  abstract = {Nowadays, interface converters based hybrid AC/DC microgrids have gained great interests in smart grids. The interface converters can perform tasks such as accurate power sharing, power quality enhancement, bidirectional power transmission, and so on by using advanced and accurate control strategies. In this work, a dc voltage droop based hierarchical control is introduced for bidirectional power transfer by an interface converter in a hybrid AC/DC microgrid. This proposed approach can exchange active power between AC or DC subgrids according to the requirement of each subgrid with slight DC voltage deviation around its nominal value. Moreover, a reactive power control algorithm is presented which can compensate the reactive power of the AC subgrid based on the interface converter's maximum rated capacity. Also, the impact of the participation of electric vehicles in the DC subgrid on the improvement of reactive power management and the capacity reduction of the interface converter is investigated. Another droop control is considered in the voltage control loop of the bidirectional boost converter in the electric vehicle to determine the participation rate of the electric vehicle in reactive power management through the charging and discharging of its battery storage system. The simulation results in Simulink MATLAB software illustrate that the compensation of reactive power by the interface converter improves significantly by employing the proposed control method and the maximum participation of electric vehicles, leading to a decrease in the rated capacity of the interface converter.},

In fact, in comparison with the traditional converters, the resonance-based solar power optimizer can offer considerable reliability and efficiency at reduced cost if unnecessary elements in its configuration are removed. In this article, a new photovoltaic boost power optimizer is introduced based on the resonance between the converter inductor and the output capacitance of the MOSFET leading to a reduction in the switching losses of the MOSFET. Using this method, the cost of the converter decreases compared with traditional methods that employ additional elements to use the resonance in the system. In the proposed converter, the MOSFET is switched on when the resonant voltage across it reaches zero or a minimum value; therefore, the switching losses decrease significantly. Also, the proposed boost power optimizer operates in a critical conduction mode (CRM) to decrease the switching losses. In addition to the reduction of MOSFET switching losses, other losses consisting of inductor copper loss, diode conduction loss, and conducting loss of MOSFET are reduced so that converter efficiency increases considerably. The proposed technique is experimentally validated using a prototype. Experimental results demonstrated that the efficiency of the boost power optimizer is as high as 98\%.},

  abstract = {Series-connected partial power converters (S-PPCs) present the advantage of reduced losses due to part of the load power be delivered without any processing, i.e., losslessly. The remaining amount of processed power is required to offer load voltage or current regulation and it is subject of switching and conduction losses. Hence, the efficiency of an S-PPC is quite dependent on keeping its voltage regulation range ( {\textbackslash}Delta v) as narrow as possible. For electric vehicles battery chargers, {\textbackslash}Delta v must cover from discharged to full charged traction battery pack voltage values, which often cover a wide voltage range and, thus, may minimize the benefits in employing S-PPC. To maintain the S-PPC advantages for such a wider voltage regulation range, this article proposes a step-up/down S-PPC with a reconfigurable H-bridge and variable turns ratio for the dc--dc stage of an integrated on-board charger (OBC). This way, {\textbackslash}Delta v is split into multiple regions, covering from narrow to wider portions that allows the design of the S-PPC to be optimized for the narrow {\textbackslash}Delta v during most of the constant current charging mode. This feature provides a significant efficiency improvement and it is achieved by using a tapped primary winding that allows the PWM switching pattern to be exchanged among the three primary-side H-bridge legs yielding in a set of three distinct transformer turns ratios specially designed to cover each region of {\textbackslash}Delta v and reducing the current through the S-PPC. In addition, zero-current switching is achieved for the primary switches and zero-voltage switching for the secondary switches, which are ensured via two fixed-frequency modulation strategies, i.e., without any additional circuit component to suppress the high-voltage spikes across the primary switches. To validate the analyzes, a scale-down prototype was built for an OBC application example (2.2 kW), reaching a peak efficiency of 98.7\% during charging.},

  abstract = {In this article, a novel nonisolated buck--boost dc--dc converter is introduced with a wide range of conversion ratios. The proposed buck--boost converter, unlike the traditional one, draws continuous current from its input port. Moreover, the proposed converter has high step-up voltage gain, which makes it suitable for industrial and renewable energy applications. Operation principles and small-signal modeling of the proposed converter are addressed in detail. Furthermore, the proposed converter is compared with other buck--boost topologies regarding different criteria, such as the number of elements, voltage gain, switch stress, and the type of input current (continuous or discontinuous). By considering the features of the proposed converter, it can be used in renewable applications, specifically in photovoltaic systems. A prototype is developed to experimentally evaluate the validation of theoretical analysis.},

The resulting controllers feature efficient drive operation without the necessity of an a priori known plant model but, so far, conduction of the corresponding training phase in real-world drive systems has been applied only sparsely due to safety concerns. This contribution targets the challenging problem of self-learning torque control for a permanent-magnet synchronous motor assuming a finite control set, i.e., the direct selection of switching actions instead of a modulator-based setup. In order to allow a secure and effective online training with real-world drive systems, the RL controller is monitored by a safeguarding algorithm that prevents application of unsafe switching actions, e.g., such that result in overcurrent. The accruing amount of measurement data is handled with the use of an edge-computing pipeline to outsource the RL training from the embedded control hardware. The inference of the utilized artificial neural network in hard real time is realized with the use of a reconfigurable field-programmable gate array architecture. The resulting RL-based algorithm is able to learn a torque control policy in just 10 min, which has been validated during comprehensive real-world experiments.},

First, available modeling methods for DAB including reduced-order model, generalized average model, and discrete-time model are classified and quantitatively compared using simulation results. Based on this comparison, recommendations for suitable DAB modeling method are given. Then, we comprehensively review the available control methods including feedback-only control, linearization control, feedforward plus feedback, disturbance-observer-based control, feedforward current control, model predictive current control, sliding mode control, and moving discretized control set model predictive control. Frequency responses of the closed-loop control-to-output and output impedance are selected as the metrics of the ability in voltage tracking and the load disturbance rejection performance. The frequency response plots of the closed-loop control-to-output transfer function and output impedance of each control method are theoretically derived or swept using simulation software PLECS and MATLAB. Based on these plots, remarks on each control method are drawn. Some practical control issues for DAB including dead-time effect, phase drift, and dc magnetic flux bias are also reviewed. This article is accompanied by PLECS simulation files of the reviewed control methods.},

This study proposes a distributed power management strategy based on the concept of coordination factors for hybrid microgrids to achieve accurate active power sharing among all AC/DC DERs (instead of the same within one sub-grid), reactive power sharing among AC DERs, and AC voltage/frequency and DC voltage restorations. Power management within a sub-grid is achieved by following the leader DER with the maximum coordination factor. Meanwhile, the BIC can establish a dynamic connection among all DERs by tracking the leaders of each sub-grid to realize power management between sub-grids. Compared to conventional methods, the proposed method can achieve accurate power sharing and voltage/frequency restorations simultaneously. Additionally, communication data and bandwidth can be significantly reduced. Finally, hardware-in-loop experiments are also performed to prove the feasibility of the proposed strategy, even during communication latency or failure.},

For instance, dc bias in ac grids can lead to several detrimental impacts, and the existing suppression methods typically require supplementary equipment. However, hybrid transformers can achieve dc bias suppression by modifying their control strategies without any extra demands. The direct dc output control signal will lead to unbalanced arm power accumulation in hybrid transformers employing modular multilevel converters with half-bridge submodules, eventually causing the converter blocked. This letter proposes a novel asymmetric operation mode of hybrid transformers for dc bias suppression, being able to output a continuous and stable dc component without incurring any additional cost. It also avoids impacting the basic functions of hybrid transformers for voltage management and dc integration. Finally, the proposed operation method has been validated through simulations and experiments. The proposed operation approach is not solely aimed at achieving converter optimization, but rather to serve the specific needs of dc bias in ac grids, expanding the functionality of the hybrid transformers further.},

This novel description, together with results from the theory of coupled oscillators, allows us to characterize the behavior of the network of inverters and loads. Specifically, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a synchronized solution that is unique and locally exponentially stable. We present a selection of controller gains leading to a desirable sharing of power among the inverters, and specify the set of loads which can be serviced without violating given actuation constraints. Moreover, we propose a distributed integral controller based on averaging algorithms, which dynamically regulates the system frequency in the presence of a time-varying load. Remarkably, this distributed-averaging integral controller has the additional property that it preserves the power sharing properties of the primary droop controller. Our results hold for any acyclic network topology, and hold without assumptions on identical line admittances or voltage magnitudes.},

A generic dynamical system model is derived, considering the coupling effects between parallelized inverters, physical constraints, and varying grid impedance. A decentralized proportional-integral state feedback control (PI-SFC) with an extended Luenberger state observer is developed and compared with a conventional PI controller regulating inverter-side currents.

Simulations and experiments confirm the functionality and robustness of the closed-loop system under varying grid impedances and during grid faults. For the experimental results, the controllers were implemented on commercially available hardware of the proposed topology. In particular, the PI-SFC allows for better exploitation of the full power of the inverters due to its enhanced controller performance and damping ability. Besides, the exceptional match between simulation and experimental results proves the accuracy of the proposed system model as well.},

Redundant states are eliminated and the system is controlled via an explicit MPC2-approach. To achieve steady-state accuracy, the system-model is augmented by a simplified grid-model to obtain a high dynamic control structure, which supersedes the use of resonant controllers and coordinate transformations. The developed control structure can handle balanced as well as unbalanced grid conditions without loss in accuracy and only consists of a single controller whithout any decoupling techniques. Furthermore, the property of MPC-schemes to explicitly respect state and input constraints facilitates the use of implicit flat-top alike modulation schemes to improve the efficiency for certain inverter topologies.},

  abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic population-based algorithm motivated by intelligent collective behavior of birds. The performance of the PSO algorithm highly depends on choosing appropriate parameters. Inertia weight is a parameter of this algorithm which was first proposed by Shi and Eberhart to bring about a balance between the exploration and exploitation characteristics of PSO. This paper presents an adaptive approach which determines the inertia weight in different dimensions for each particle, based on its performance and distance from its best position. Each particle will then have different roles in different dimensions of the search environment. By considering the stability condition and an adaptive inertia weight, the acceleration parameters of PSO are adaptively determined. The corresponding approach is called stability-based adaptive inertia weight (SAIW). The proposed method and some other models for adjusting the inertia weight are evaluated and compared. The efficiency of SAIW is validated on 22 static test problems, moving peaks benchmarks (MPB) and a real-world problem for a radar system design. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model greatly improves the PSO performance in terms of the solution quality as well as convergence speed in static and dynamic environments.},

In this article, a quarter car model and a Bouc-Wen-based magnetorheological (MR) damper model are developed to combine the control of PSO identification and PSO-LQR controller in the semi-active suspension system. The MR damper was performed with an experimental test for running identification using experimental data as input into the Bouc-Wen model to obtain six unknown parameters, where the parameters were estimated with the PSO algorithm. Since the numerical model has been done with all parameters clear, the need for damping force from suspension is obtained by means of running the model using an input current. In the employment of PSO for damper model and vehicle control, the dual applications succeeded in verifying the feasibility of parameter identification in the MR damper and successfully tuned the LQR controller in the semi-active suspension, which decreases the vehicle body acceleration and displacement so that the improvement of ride comfort and drive stability achieved.},

To solve them, a four-quadrant buck-boost partial power converter (PPC) is proposed, in which the internal DC/DC of the converter flows only a small portion of the total power, while the remaining power is transferred directly between the battery and the DC bus through the feedforward path. This paper examines the performance evaluation methods of the PPC from various perspectives. It describes the advantages and limitations of the four-quadrant buck-boost PPC, and presents a design for the topology and control strategy based on a CLLC resonant circuit. Through simulation, the automatic operation of the converter in all four modes is achieved.

These shortcomings include steady-state errors in single-phase systems and the need for synchronous d--q transformation in three-phase systems. Based on similar control theory, PR filters can also be used for generating the harmonic command reference precisely in an active power filter, especially for single-phase systems, where d--q transformation theory is not directly applicable. Another advantage associated with the PR controllers and filters is the possibility of implementing selective harmonic compensation without requiring excessive computational resources. Given these advantages and the belief that PR control will find wide-ranging applications in grid-interfaced converters, PR control theory is revised in detail with a number of practical cases that have been implemented previously, described clearly to give a comprehensive reference on PR control and filtering.},

The grid interfacing converters in the distribution system, such as the distributed generation (DG) interfacing converters or hybrid ac/dc grid interlinking converters, can participate in distribution grid harmonic control. In this paper, two virtual-impedance-based harmonics control methods are developed for grid interfacing voltagesource inverters (VSIs) to improve the power quality of the distribution grid. As the control parameters are designed based on the virtual impedance theory, clear physical meanings are given to explain their impacts on the system. Also, the proposed methods do not rely on the closed loop feedback control and, therefore, are very suitable for VSIs with low switching frequency (such as those for high-power DGs or interlinking converters for hybrid ac/dc systems), whose closed-loop control feedback bandwidth may be limited for harmonic regulation. The influence of system delay and feedback control loop is considered and modeled in the design procedure; thus more accurate virtual impedance control is achieved for low-switching-frequency VSIs. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison of the two methods, including stability and harmonic compensation performance, are given. Their effectiveness is verified by experiment results.},

A visualization scheme for the power density of the topology is proposed for the first time. The topology synthesis method offers a fresh perspective for systematically explaining existing topologies.

Nonisolated topologies can be systematically synthesized and classified from the perspective of PPP.

  abstract = {In order to alleviate the negative impacts of harmonically distorted grid conditions on inverters, this paper presents a linear quadratic regulator (LQR)-based current control design for an inductive-capacitive-inductive (LCL)-filtered grid-connected inverter. The proposed control scheme is constructed based on the internal model (IM) principle in which a full-state feedback controller is used for the purpose of stabilization and the integral terms as well as resonant terms are augmented into a control structure for the reference tracking and harmonic compensation, respectively. Additionally, the proposed scheme is implemented in the synchronous reference frame (SRF) to take advantage of the simultaneous compensation for both the negative and positive sequence harmonics by one resonant term. Since this leads to the decrease of necessary resonant terms by half, the computation effort of the controller can be reduced. With regard to the full-state feedback control approach for the LCL-filtered grid connected inverter, additional sensing devices are normally required to measure all of the system state variables. However, this causes a complexity in hardware and high implementation cost for measurement devices. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a discrete-time current full-state observer that uses only the information from the control input, grid-side current sensor, and grid voltage sensor to estimate all of the system state variables with a high precision. Finally, an optimal linear quadratic control approach is introduced for the purpose of choosing optimal feedback gains, systematically, for both the controller and full-state observer.

  abstract = {To benefit from the advantages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in industrial control applications, RL methods can be used for optimal tuning of the classical controllers based on the simulation scenarios of operating conditions. In this study, the Twin Delay Deep Deterministic (TD3) policy gradient method, which is an effective actor-critic RL strategy, is implemented to learn optimal Proportional Integral (PI) controller dynamics from a Direct Current (DC) motor speed control simulation environment. For this purpose, the PI controller dynamics are introduced to the actor-network by using the PI-based observer states from the control simulation environment. A suitable Simulink simulation environment is adapted to perform the training process of the TD3 algorithm. The actor-network learns the optimal PI controller dynamics by using the reward mechanism that implements the minimization of the optimal control objective function. A setpoint filter is used to describe the desired setpoint response, and step disturbance signals with random amplitude are incorporated in the simulation environment to improve disturbance rejection control skills with the help of experience based learning in the designed control simulation environment. When the training task is completed, the optimal PI controller coefficients are obtained from the weight coefficients of the actor-network. The performance of the optimal PI dynamics, which were learned by using the TD3 algorithm and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm, are compared. Moreover, control performance improvement of this RL based PI controller tuning method (RL-PI) is demonstrated relative to performances of both integer and fractional order PI controllers that were tuned by using several popular metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimization and Differential Evolution.},

  abstract = {This work presents control of interlinking converter for adaptive operation of hybrid microgrid. The hybrid microgrid (HMG) consists of canal based small hydro generation combined with solar panel tied at AC bus. A battery-based energy storage unit (ESU) is used, that balances the DC bus voltage whereas the interlinking converter (ILC) balances the AC bus frequency and voltage in the off-grid scenarios. Besides, multimode operation of interlinking converter is also tabulated. In the grid connected mode, the voltages at the PCC are governed by grid hence ILC operates in the current control mode to inject power from distributed energy sources to the grid. While ESU supports the DC bus. The objective of the HMG is that it meets both AC and DC load demand irrespective of the operating modes. The system possesses grid synchronization capability. It is noteworthy to mention that PVC AC/DC converter is used not only to transfer the active power from PV array to the grid but also supports the grid by providing reactive power. The harmonics and reactive power demand of the local loads are met by the ILC. This is accomplished by employing a total least square based adaptive filter. The hybrid microgrid is simulated on a MATLAB/Simulink platform to validate the modes of operation and a comparative analysis w.r.t to other adaptive filters is presented. Lastly, the system is tested on an OPAL-RT based real time simulator.},

WECS is connected via static power electronic switch (SPES). The notion of ac/dc MG has emerged due to progress in both ac- and dc-based renewable energy sources (RESs) and loads. Ac and dc buses are adjoined using an interlinking converter (ILC) for bidirectional exchange of power. Depending upon generation and demand, four operating modes of hybrid ac/dc MG are formed, which allow independent operation at both ac and dc bus. Modes are formed to maximize utilization of RESs at their respective buses. Maximum power point algorithms are used to extract maximum power from WECS and solar PV array. Moreover, a filtered-x affine projection Versoria (FxAPV) adaptive filter is employed to extract active and reactive parts of load currents so that stator currents of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) and hydrogenerator are harmonics free. System voltage and frequency of ac bus are controlled using ILC, whereas bidirectional dc--dc converter (BDDC) regulates voltage on dc side. Performance of system is verified on a hardware prototype.},

The GNAP theory was implemented previously in the parallel AF. In this study, the theory is proposed for the 3P4L USPAF system to compensate non-sinusoidal periodic and non-periodic currents and voltages. Distorted source voltages and unbalanced non-linear load currents compensation were verified simultaneously through the 3P4L USPAF system experimental prototype. Sub-harmonic and stochastic non-periodic current/voltage compensations were analyzed through simulations with Matlab/Simulink software. The simulation and experimental results showed that the theory proposed for the 3P4L USPAF system was applicable to non-active power compensation in three-phase four-wire (3P4W) systems under periodic and non-periodic disturbances.},

The chapter starts with a relatively simple tuning of a cascaded PI speed and position control system for a BLDC servo drive. This example serves as the background for a discussion on selecting the objective function for the PSO. Then the PSO is used in two challenging controller tuning tasks. This includes optimizing selected learning parameters in the adaptive artificial neural network (ANN) based online trained speed controller for an urban vehicle (3D problem) and selecting penalty factors in the LQR with augmented state (i.e. with oscillatory terms) for a three-phase four-leg sine wave inverter (15D problem). It is demonstrated with the help of these case studies why and where the PSO, or any other similar population based stochastic search algorithm, can be beneficial. Engineers encounter many non-straightforward controller tuning problems in power electronic systems and this chapter illustrates that in some cases it is relatively easy to reduce these tasks into the objective function selection problem. The relevant controller parameters are then determined automatically by the PSO.},

  abstract = {In this paper different randomness scenarios for the recently developed direct particle swarm controller for repetitive processes are investigated and compared. The proposed controller employs the particle swarm optimizer (PSO) to solve in on-line mode the dynamic optimization problem (DOP) designed to shape the control signal in the constant-amplitude constant-frequency (CACF) voltage source inverter (VSI) with an LC output filter. The controller is of a stochastic nature. The DOP at hand is of {$\alpha$}D dimensionality, where {$\alpha$} denotes the number of control signal samples per each period of the reference voltage signal. Originally, the PSO requires pseudorandom number generators (PRNG) to be run throughout the iterative search to get a new set of numbers in each sample time. In DOP scenarios the swarm has to be kept alive during the operation of the inverter. This in turn implies that the pseudorandom numbers are to be generated in real-time using digital signal controller (DSC) resources. Four different randomization schemes have been tested: the dimension-and-particle-wise one, the dimension-wise one, the particle-wise one and an almost-deterministic one (also known as a list-based PSO). The last approach does not employ any PRNG in real time and as such establishes an appealing alternative in terms of its low computational burden. The effectiveness of such a scheme, when applied to the direct swarm controller, has been studied numerically in the paper.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a novel repetitive control of the constant-amplitude constant-frequency (CACF) voltagesource inverter (VSI) suitable for uninterruptible power supply (UPS) applications. The control system consists of three parts: a repetitive feedback controller, a repetitive disturbance feedforward controller and a non-repetitive full-state feedback controller. The repetitive feedback part is synthetized using the recently developed plug-in direct particle swarm repetitive control (PDPSRC) strategy. This approach is free from long-term stability issues encountered in the classical iterative learning control (ILC) schemes. The repetitive disturbance feedforward part is the extension of a non-repetitive disturbance feedforward controller. The repetitiveness of the load current has been harnessed to reduce the influence of the delay introduced by the digital control system. This makes the disturbance feedforward path more effective in comparison to the standard one. The non-repetitive controller is employed here just to increase damping in the system which is naturally significantly underdamped. A standard technique of full-state feedback and pole placement has been used to calculate its gains. The resulting control system has been tested with the help of numerical simulations.},

The procedure involves particle-swarm-based search for the best weighting factors in the quadratic cost function. It is common practice that the weights in the cost function are set using the guess-and-check method. However, it becomes quite challenging, and usually very time-consuming, if there are many auxiliary states added to the system. In order to immunize the system against unbalanced and nonlinear loads, oscillatory terms are incorporated into the control scheme, and this significantly increases the number of weights to be guessed. All controller gains are determined altogether in one LQR procedure call, and the originality reported here refers to evolutionary tuning of the weighting matrix. There is only one penalty factor to be set by the designer during the controller synthesis procedure. This coefficient enables shaping the dynamics of the closed-loop system by penalizing the dynamics of control signals instead of selecting individual weighting factors for augmented state vector components. Simulational tuning and experimental verification (the physical converter at the level of 21 kVA) are included.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a recently developed repetitive neurocontroller (RNC) that does not require additional filtering and/or forgetting to robustify it, i.e. to circumvent the long horizon stability issue present in the classic iterative learning control (ILC) scheme. Initially, the Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) error backpropagation (BP) algorithm was used as a DOP(dynamic optimization problem)-capable search mechanism. At that time the choice of the training algorithm was made based on the frequently reported effectiveness of the L-M method in static optimization problems. However, there is an abundance of neural network training methods characterized, e.g., by different convergence rates, computational burden, noise sensitivity, etc. The performance of a particular optimization method is always problem specific. The case study of a constant-amplitude constant-frequency (CACF) voltage-source inverter (VSI) with an LC output filter is analysed here and some recommendations regarding the trade-off between convergence rate and computational complexity are made. The robustness to a measurement noise is also tested. The comparison is based on the results of numerical experiments. A couple of algorithms is then suggested for real-time implementation.},

  abstract = {The majority of the paper is devoted to debunking flawed methods proposed in the literature within the context of multiresonant control systems for grid-connected converters and then a novel approach is proposed. Several flawed approaches to grid tied power electronic converters (rectifiers and shunt active power filters) are discussed to initiate a critical discussion regarding some tuning methods reported in the topical literature. In this paper we analytically show that some of them are even erroneous from the control theory point of view or are based on mathematically erroneous derivations. That is especially prevalent for papers in which the Naslin polynomial method is employed to tune proportional-multiresonant controllers. Some authors recognize that the resulting control systems are not robust, i.e. not practical, and use obtained gains only as a starting point for further tuning using the trial and error method or evolutionary global optimization. Robustness of such systems is often not guaranteed and if it occurs at all, it is by chance or thanks to a combination of luck and expert knowledge of the engineer (not by deliberate design). Therefore, the absence of such a guarantee motivates the search for better ways to tune such controllers. As a result, a practical robust controller tuning method for multiresonant grid current controllers is proposed and verified experimentally. We are convinced that one of the solutions can be based on the disk margin stability analysis and a global search algorithm. The required robustness is expressed as stability margins. The design procedure is very user-friendly and the disk size is the key design parameter to be selected by an engineer. The practicality of the tuning method is demonstrated empirically in a 10 kVA physical grid-tied converter.},

  abstract = {Load and supply parameters may be uncertain in microgrids (MGs) due for instance to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources among others. Guaranteeing reliable and stable MGs despite parameter uncertainties is crucial for their correct operation. Their stability and dynamical features are directly related to the controllers' parameters and power-sharing coefficients. Hence, to maintain power good quality within the desirable range of system parameters and to have a satisfactory response to sudden load changes, careful selection of the controllers and power-sharing coefficients are necessary. In this paper, a simple design approach for the optimal design of controllers' parameters is presented in an islanded MG. To that aim, an optimization problem is formulated based on a small-signal state-space model and solved by three different optimization techniques including particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and a proposed approach based on the combination of both PSO and GA. The optimized coefficients are selected to guarantee desirable static and dynamic responses in a wide range of operations regardless of the number of inverters, system configuration, output impedance differences, and load types. Through the proposed design and tuning method, the performance of the MG is improved as compared to those obtained using state-of-art techniques. This fact is demonstrated by using numerical simulations performed on a detailed model implemented in PSIM{\copyright} software.},

  abstract = {In this work, the modeling of a three-phase four wires inverter and the design of two control schemes for its grid-disconnected operation are presented. The advantages of the four-wire topology are that by means of a coordinate transformation (Park transformation) it is possible to obtain a decoupled linear model, as well as feeding single-phase and three-phase loads in this operating mode. In the model, two control loops are taken into account: a current loop (controller slave) and a voltage loop (controller master) with the aim that this inverter can regulate its output voltage and when it is supplied to a local load.. The contributions of this work is present in the inverter modeling, the method for obtaining the transfer functions and in the controllers design obtained by this method. The inverter model allows to easily obtain the transfer functions of both loops; this is very important for the control area, considering that using classical control techniques and the methodology proposed in this work, the gains can be obtained directly and not adjusted to trial and error. The main advantage of this proposal is that when the kp and ki gains are obtained through the Bode diagrams, we can obtain generalized integrators; applying the coordinate transformation method to the integral gain that was obtained by the design of the PI controller in direct current (dc); This method is described in detail in the presented work and allows obtaining a new controller called proportional controller plus generalized integrator (P+GI). This controller presents a good performance, since it can follow sinusoidal references, in addition to presenting a better disturbances rejection due to the high gains it presents at the grid frequency and harmonic frequencies of the load.},

To obtain ZVS with the proposed modulation strategy, the buck+boost inductance is selected and the switches are gated in a way that the inductor current has a negative offset current at the beginning and the end of each pulse period. This allows the MOSFET switches to turn on when the antiparallel body diode is conducting. As the novel modulation strategy is a software-only solution, there are no additional expenses for the active or passive components compared to conventional modulation implementations. Furthermore, an analytical and simulation investigation predicts an excellent efficiency over the complete operating range and a higher power density for a nonisolated multiphase converter equipped with the low-loss modulation.

  abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) of power electronic converters has obtained much attention in many applications and especially in electric motor control. As the control loop is closed by predicting the future plant behavior by means of a mathematical model, disturbances and uncertainties are important aspects when using any MPC strategy. The plant model may be inaccurate due to plenty of reasons, such as parameter mismatches or the inverter nonlinearity. If these disturbances are not properly addressed during the MPC design process, the control performance is deteriorated. Hence, a suitable disturbance observer (DOB) is required to compensate for model inaccuracies. This contribution is comparing different lumped-DOB designs in the context of a continuous-control set MPC for induction motor current control. As a baseline for comparison, a field-oriented proportional-integral (PI)-type regulator is utilized which does not require a DOB due to its integral feedback.Comprehensive experimental results prove the necessity of a proper DOB; however, it is also shown that the overall transient and steady-state control improvement due to MPC has to be bought at a high price since the computational burden is at least doubled compared to the PI-baseline.},

However, the high-frequency switching loss of GaN devices has become one of the important factors restricting the improvement of converter efficiency. Aiming at improving the efficiency of the synchronous rectification boost topology, this paper first discusses the advantages of the boost converter operating in the boundary conduction mode (BCM). In order to fully ensure the realization of soft switching in BCM mode, this paper has carried on the in-depth mathematical modeling analysis to the realization process of soft switching. The conclusion points out that the implementation range of soft switching can be extended by prolonging the conduction time of synchronous rectification. Finally, an experimental prototype with a rated power of 500W was built to verify the theoretical analysis. By ensuring the implementation of soft switching in BCM mode, the peak efficiency of the prototype reaches 98.2\%. The correctness of the theoretical analysis in this paper is verified.},

This article presents a robust current model predictive control method which significantly expands the bandwidth of the current loop. The proposed method is based on an incremental model which can avoid the disturbance of inaccurate flux linkage. However, disturbance from inaccurate inductors and resistors in the motor model can also affect predictive control. To cope with this problem, the proposed method combines with an extended state observer (ESO) which is used to estimate disturbance and compensate for it.

  abstract = {A widely recognized shortcoming of model predictive control (MPC) is that it can usually only be used in applications with slow dynamics, where the sample time is measured in seconds or minutes. A well-known technique for implementing fast MPC is to compute the entire control law offline, in which case the online controller can be implemented as a lookup table. This method works well for systems with small state and input dimensions (say, no more than five), few constraints, and short time horizons. In this paper, we describe a collection of methods for improving the speed of MPC, using online optimization. These custom methods, which exploit the particular structure of the MPC problem, can compute the control action on the order of 100 times faster than a method that uses a generic optimizer. As an example, our method computes the control actions for a problem with 12 states, 3 controls, and horizon of 30 time steps (which entails solving a quadratic program with 450 variables and 1284 constraints) in around 5 ms, allowing MPC to be carried out at 200 Hz.},

The proposed secondary control scheme can remove the dc voltage deviation and improve the current sharing accuracy by using voltage-shifting and slope-adjusting approaches simultaneously. Meanwhile, the average value of droop coefficients is calculated, and then it is controlled by an additional controller included in the distributed secondary control layer to ensure that each droop coefficient converges at a reasonable value. Hence, by adjusting the droop coefficient, each participating converter has equal output impedance, and the accurate proportional load current sharing can be achieved with different line resistances. Furthermore, the current sharing performance in steady and transient states can be enhanced by using the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by detailed experimental tests based on a 3 {\texttimes} 1 kW prototype with three interface converters.},

In terms of FSBB's control strategies, the traditional single-mode strategy is low efficiency. While the two-mode strategy's control loop is relatively complicated. What's more, near the two modes' switching point, the converter will continuously switch between the Buck and Boost modes, which is not conducive to the stable operation of the system. So this paper proposes an improved single-mode control strategy. By fixing the switches' duty cycle of the Buck unit and controlling the duty cycle of the Boost unit, FSBB is enabled the function of buck-boost only in Boost mode. Also, an 80-160V input and 125-250V output prototype was built in the laboratory to verify the proposed strategy.},

Hybrid distribution transformers (HDTs) are an important means of addressing these issues. They have good flexibility in voltage regulation and huge development potential. To analyze the operating status and losses of an HDT, this study constructs a simplified equivalent impedance model for an HDT. First, the operating principle, characteristics, and voltage regulation range of a direct AC/AC HDT were analyzed. Second, based on the state--space averaging method, we obtain the HDT single-phase average circuit topology and construct an HDT relaxed two-port network model. Third, considering the operating losses of the transformer, Thevenin equivalent parameters of an HDT were derived. Then, a simplified equivalent impedance model for an HDT and the corresponding control strategies are presented. Finally, we verify the correctness and rationality of the proposed theory by constructing an HDT simulation model.},

The uniform control strategy unifies different control structures for multifunctional BIC in terms of power management, ac and dc voltage support. With the unified control structure, various triggering mechanisms for BIC mode-switch are not compulsory in response to the relevant scenario changes in the power network. Therefore, the negative consequences, such as unsmooth transition and system collapse due to the inaccurate or slower mode switch, can be avoided. Moreover, the uniform control strategy is also applicable for the hierarchical controlled hybrid microgrid, whose control architecture is typically comprised of the centralized and decentralized levels. This enables the communication fault ride-through capability and the impact from the communication failures can thus be mitigated. To sum up the above two features, the proposed control strategy is able to provide a smooth operation for the BIC without control mode switch in the event of unintentional scenario changes in power or communication network. To verify the validity of the proposed uniform control strategy, the controller hardware-in-the-loop experimental results have been provided in this paper.},

  abstract = {Hybrid AC/DC networks are an effective solution for future power systems, due to their ability to combine advantages of both AC and DC networks. However, they bring new technological challenges, one key area being the control of such a network. The network, and especially the interlinking converter (ILC), must be controlled to ensure that the DC and AC subsystems coordinate to stabilize the network and allocate power appropriately. This is an area which has attracted considerable recent interest due to the non-triviality of the control design. One promising tool is passivity theory which allows the derivation of decentralized conditions through which the stability of the network can be guaranteed. This paper investigates the application of a passivity framework to AC/DC grids, using a typical lossless line assumption. By ensuring that an appropriately formulated passivity condition is satisfied by the AC and DC buses, and the interlinking converter, the stability of the interconnection can be guaranteed. We also discuss how the ILC controller may be designed to achieve an appropriate power allocation between AC and DC sources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ILC control design regulates the frequency and voltages of the hybrid AC/DC network with a stable operation maintained.},

This hybrid structure utilizes FSBBs to regulate its output voltage by adjusting its duty cycle, handling a small portion of the total power, and providing a fast dynamic response. Meanwhile, the CLLC in the structure operates in a complete resonant state to ensure high system efficiency. By sharing a bridge arm between the FSBB and the CLLC, where one arm from each system serves a similar function, the number of switches utilized is significantly reduced, resulting in higher system efficiency. In addition to the structural improvements, to achieve a higher average system efficiency under different loads, this article presents an efficiency-based parameter design methodology. Furthermore, phase shift, an additional control freedom of FSBB, is employed to further enhance the system's overall efficiency; however, calculating the relationship between efficiency and phase shift can be burdensome, especially in real-time controllers. To address this issue, this article proposes a fitting-model-based maximum efficiency tracking approach to reduce calculation complexity. Ultimately, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design, highlighting its enhanced performance.},

For this, two partial power and two interleaving methods are evaluated in terms of efficiency and performance. The selected topology consists of input-parallel-output-parallel interleaved DC/DC converters, which together with the control strategy, allows a high efficiency photovoltaic system, unlike conventional topologies. However, this type of topology is prone to present an unbalanced power distribution between the DC/DC power cells, mainly due to the natural differences between their components. This paper shows the application of a power balancing control strategy for interleaved partial power converters, which guarantees an equitable power distribution, therefore, it enables a correct sizing of the components. The simulation results show the correct operation of the power cells, in terms of overall high efficiency and power distribution among the power cells.},

However, this circuit will face the problem of operating mode switching when the input voltage is close to the output voltage. Considering this problem, the principles of the NIBB converter are analyzed in this article. The duty cycle combinations of an NIBB converter are analyzed, and an analysis method for the mode transition problem from a geometric perspective is proposed. Using the two-edge pulsewidth modulation method, a novel bumpless mode transition control method is proposed. A nonlinear feedforward controller with hysteresis is designed according to the state equation of the circuit. Moreover, the inductor current reference value is compensated when the mode is switched so that the mode transition problem of the NIBB circuit is effectively solved. In addition, a small-signal analysis of the proposed method is performed. The analysis shows that the proposed method has good stability and dynamic performance in various typical conditions. A 10-kW NIBB prototype is built in this article, and the corresponding experimental scenarios are designed. The experimental results show that compared with the results of unified PI control during the mode transition, the transient oscillation of the output voltage is smaller, and the duration of the transient process is shorter.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an active front-end converter for medium-voltage current-source drives. It comprises two series-connected pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) rectifiers fed from a delta-wye isolation transformer. These employ sequential-sampling synchronous space-vector modulation (SVM), and operate at a switching frequency of 100 Hz, thus reducing the switching losses by 66\% compared to previous PWM approaches. Digital processing requirements of this technique are minimized by using decision-making SVM. This online modulation technique ensures full harmonic current cancellation through the magnetic interface, and minimizes the sampling/control-action delay. Therefore it enables the use of advanced control strategies notwithstanding the low sampling frequency of the control system. Exploiting this fact, the proposed converter is controlled using a nonlinear strategy in the synchronous frame. The strategy employs input-output and feedback linearization, and is derived from the complex-signal flow diagram of the converter. The proposed strategy linearizes and partially decouples the converter d-q-axes dynamics, ensuring a dynamic response totally independent from the operating point, even under regeneration. This is a highly desirable feature for high-performance drives presenting continuous transitions from motoring to regeneration. Moreover, the converter presents an independent active and reactive power flow, which enables it to operate as a reactive power compensator if desired. Computer analysis and experimental work with a TMS320C32 digital-signal-processor-based 5-kVA laboratory prototype validate the excellent results attained by the proposed converter.},

However, in practice, communication delays are inevitable and seriously threaten the real-time energy sharing equilibrium. While many asynchronous methods aim to address this, they ignore the learnability of prosumer's response and often struggle to balance convergence speed and stability. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel asynchronous algorithm based on best response (BR) learning. First, we demonstrate that the prosumer's best response in ADMM-based energy sharing can be represented as the piecewise linear function. Besides, we propose a batch-fitting method to learn the BR function with high accuracy and low computational cost. Building on this, we develop an asynchronous ADMM algorithm with a practical error criterion to ensure strict convergence of energy sharing under severe delays. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve faster convergence with fewer iterations and greater reliability across various energy sharing scales and asynchronous rates than existing asynchronous algorithms.},

  abstract = {Grid-tied voltage source inverters using LCL filter have been widely adopted in distributed power generation systems (DPGSs). As high-order LCL filters contain multiple resonant frequencies, switching harmonics generated by the inverter and current harmonics generated by the active/passive loads would cause the system resonance, and thus the output current distortion and oscillation. Such phenomenon is particularly critical when the power grid is weak with the unknown grid impedance. In order to stabilize the operation of the DPGS and improve the waveform of the injected currents, many innovative damping methods have been proposed. A comprehensive overview on those contributions and their classification on the inverter- and grid-side damping measures are presented. Based on the concept of the impedance-based stability analysis, all damping methods can ensure the system stability by modifying the effective output impedance of the inverter or the effective grid impedance. Classical damping methods for industrial applications will be analyzed and compared. Finally, the future trends of the impedance-based stability analysis, as well as some promising damping methods, will be discussed.},

Therefore, recognizing the inherent relationship and intrinsic differences between inverters and RSGs is essential for such target. By modeling the typical electromechanical transient of grid-tied PWM inverters, this paper first proves that PWM inverters and RSGs are similar in physical mechanism and equivalent in mathematical model, and the concept of static synchronous generator (SSG) is thereby developed. Furthermore, the comprehensive comparison between RSG and SSG is carried out in detail, and their inherent relation is built. Based on these findings, the rationality and feasibility of migrating the concepts, tools, and methods of RSG stability analysis to investigate the dynamic behaviors and stability issues of SSG is therefore confirmed. Taking stability issues as an example, the criteria of small signal and transient stability of a typical grid-tied PWM inverter is put forward to demonstrate the significance of the developed SSG model (including synchronizing coefficient, damping coefficient, inertia constant, and power-angle curve), providing clear physical interpretation on the dynamic characteristics and stability issues.

This study introduces a novel hybrid transformer topology and multi-mode control strategy to achieve coordinated voltage and reverse power regulation in active distribution networks. The proposed hybrid transformer combines conventional transformer windings with a partially rated SiC-MOSFET-based back-to-back converter, reducing additional investment costs and enhancing system reliability. A multi-mode control strategy is proposed to facilitate the concurrent reverse power control and voltage violation mitigation of the presented hybrid transformer, allowing a smooth transition between the P--Q control mode and the V--f control mode. The control mode switching can be activated manually or autonomously in response to voltage violations or reverse power overloading. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid transformer configuration and its control mode transition mechanism are examined through comprehensive case studies conducted in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment. The proposed HT design has been confirmed to achieve a voltage regulation range of {\textpm}20\% of the nominal voltage and effectively regulate bidirectional active power flow within a range of -25\% to 25\% of the rated power.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a hybrid transformer topology and its control method for active distribution networks. The hybrid distribution transformer consists of transformer windings and a back-to-back converter. The transformer windings are composed of a high-voltage winding, a low-voltage winding, and a control winding. The back-to-back power converter is formed by connecting two fully controlled SiC inverters in a back-to-back configuration. Its two AC ports are connected to the high-voltage and control windings through filtering inductors. When the hybrid transformer is used as a distribution transformer in an active distribution network, the low-voltage side can seamlessly switch between voltage-frequency control and active-reactive control strategies based on the comparison between the renewable penetration level and the renewable hosting capacity of the distribution network. This allows for constant voltage-frequency control when the renewable penetration level is low, and bidirectional power flow control when the renewable penetration level exceeds the hosting capacity, thus ensuring the safe integration of renewable generation systems and improving the power quality of active distribution networks.},

System sensitivity to parameter variation is handled through an additional quadratic trajectory parametric sensitivity term in the standard LQ criterion to be minimized. The main purpose here is to find a suboptimal linear quadratic control taking explicitly into account the parametric uncertainties. The paper main contribution is threefold: 1) A descriptor system approach is used to show that the underlying singular linear-quadratic optimal control problem leads to a non-standard Riccati equation. 2) A solution to the proposed control problem is then given based on a connection to the so-called Lur'e matrix equations. 3) A synthesis method of multiple parametric SCLQ controllers is proposed to cover the whole parametric uncertainty while degrading as less as possible the intrinsic robustness properties of each local linear quadratic controller. Some examples are presented in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

Multiple control objectives are developed, aiming to eliminate DC fluctuation, reduce AC distortion and imbalance, and achieve negative sequence current sharing among distributed generations in the AC subgrid. To realize these control objectives, a two-layer coordinated control strategy is proposed. The first layer involves local interlinking converter (IC) control to improve the power quality of the DC subgrid, while the second layer focuses on distributed unbalance compensation control to improve the power quality of the AC subgrid.

HDT can work as an energy hub of an AC/DC hybrid distribution network, and an AC/DC hybrid distribution system can be formed by several hybrid distribution networks based on HDTs interconnection. In this paper, the structure of AC / DC hybrid distribution system based on HDT cluster interconnection is presented. To achieve the power balance inside the AC/DC hybrid distribution system, the interconnection power of each HDT should be allocated, and the power allocation strategy of HDTs based on time consistency algorithm is further proposed. The application of time consistency algorithm enables each HDT to obtain system average power information under the sparse communication condition. Based on the system average power information, the power state of system is analyzed, and an allocation method is proposed to allocate the interconnection power between HDTs in power excess and shortage states. The excess power of power excess HDTs are properly allocated and transferred to the power shortage HDTs, then the power complementarity between HDTs and the system power balance can be achived. The effectiveness of the proposed power allocation strategy is verified by MATLAB simulation results.},

In view of the small-signal and large-signal control laws of the derived IVFF functions, the two-mode PS-TEM control schemes with small-signal and large-signal IVFF compensations are proposed, respectively.

Due to the existence of the resonant inductor (including the leakage inductor), the FB-boost converter can only adopt the two-edge-modulation (TEM) scheme with the FB cell being leading-edge modulated and the boost cell being trailing-edge modulated to minimize the inductor current ripple over the input-voltage range, and a phase-shift-control-scheme-based TEM with the use of the market available controller IC such as UC3895 is proposed, which realizes phase-shifted control for the FB cell to achieve zero-voltage switching. In order to improve the reliability and efficiency of the FB-boost converter, a three-mode dual-frequency control scheme is proposed, in which the FB-boost converter operates in boost, FB-boost and FB modes in low, medium and high input voltage regions, respectively, and for which the expression of the inductor current ripple is derived in this paper. As the input voltage in the FB-boost mode is close to the output voltage, the inductor current ripple in this mode is much smaller than that in the other modes, and the switching frequency of the boost cell in this mode can be lowered to one-(2N+1)th of the preset switching frequency to reduce the switching loss, and hence, to improve the efficiency. A 250-500 V input, 360 V output, and 6 kW rated power prototype is fabricated to verify the effectiveness of the design and control method. The average efficiency over the input-voltage range is 96.5\%, and the highest efficiency attained is 97.2\%.},

The proposed three-port converter (TPC) consists of a buck--boost converter, interposed between the battery storage system and the DC-AC inverter, in series with PV modules. The buck--boost converter in the proposed TPC is utilized for maximum power point tracking by regulating two power switches. The output power of the proposed converter is regulated by controlling the DC-AC converter. During the battery-charging mode, partial power regulation is employed with a direct power flow path (the series-connection of the PV panel, the battery and the output). As resistances in this path are almost negligible, the power conversion efficiency is higher than existing topologies. During battery-discharging mode, the power conversion is processed through a buck--boost converter with only two active power switches and one inductor. With fewer components, higher power conversion efficiency is also achieved. The circuit operation and analysis are presented in detail. To illustrate the simplicity of the converter control, the performance of the converter is tested with a straightforward maximum power point tracking on a PV system with battery cells. Simulation and experimental tests are carried out to demonstrate circuit operation and power conversion efficiency.},

  abstract = {Grid-forming inverters (GFI) play an important role as power interfaces for distributed generation units in islanded microgrids, where inductive-capacitive-inductive (LCL) output filters are commonly employed to mitigate the harmonics injected by voltage-source inverters. Due to advantages such as fast dynamic response and straightforward handling of constraints, Finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) has become an attractive option for voltage control in GFI systems. However, conventional FCS-MPC algorithms with short prediction horizon have performance limitations in the tracking of ac references in systems with high-order dynamics, such as LCL-filtered GFIs. On the other hand, predictive algorithms with extended prediction horizons suffer from an increased computational burden. This paper proposes a new FCS-MPC algorithm to accurately control the capacitor voltage in an LCL-filtered GFI, using a discrete-time prediction model to dynamically compute the reference for a FCS-MPC inverter-side current controller. The main advantages of the proposed method are its simple implementation without requiring the tuning of weighting factors in its cost function; and its short prediction horizon, which maintains a reduced computational cost. Moreover, active resonance damping elements such as digital filters or ad hoc feedback loops to deal with the LCL filter resonance are not required. Simulation tests and experimental results in a laboratory-scale setup confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm, yielding lower distortion of output voltage waveforms and increased robustness to modeling errors compared with the conventional FCS-MPC approach.},

  abstract = {Two-stage photovoltaic (PV) configurations have become increasingly popular due to the decoupling between the inverter dc-link voltage and the PV voltage, adding flexibility to extend the maximum power point tracking range. However, the additional dc-dc converter increases the power converter losses. The concept of partial power converters (PPCs), which reduce the amount of power handled by the dc stage, can mitigate this effect. However, the type of topology, its power and voltage rating, efficiency, and an operating range can vary significantly depending on the function (boosting or reducing voltage) and type of PV application and scale (micro-, string-, or multi-sting inverter). This paper analyzes the possible configuration of connections of PPC depending on the application and scale of the PV system and introduces a new buck-type PPC. Three solutions for practical PV systems are further elaborated, including experimental validation. Results show that the PPC concept greatly improves the overall PV system efficiency with the added benefit that the dc-dc stage power ratings achieved are only a fraction of the PV system, reducing size and cost of the power converter without affecting the system performance.},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems composed by two energy conversion stages are attractive from an operation point of view. This is because the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) range is extended, due to the voltage decoupling between the PV system and the dc-link. Nevertheless, the additional dc-dc conversion stage increases the volume, cost and power converter losses. Therefore, central inverters based on a single-stage converter, have been a mainstream solution to interface large-scale PV arrays composed of several strings connected in parallel made by the series connections of PV modules. The concept of partial power converters (PPC), previously reported as a voltage step-up stage, has not addressed in depth for all types of PV applications. In this work, a PPC performing voltage step-down operation is proposed and analyzed. This concept is interesting from the industry point of view, since with the new isolation standards of PV modules are reaching 1500 V, increasing both the size of the string and dc-link voltage for single-stage inverters. Since grid connection remains typically at 690 V, larger strings impose more demanding operation for single-stage central inverters (required to operate at lower modulation indexes and demand higher blocking voltage devices), making the proposed step-down PPC an attractive solution. Theoretical analysis and an experimental test-bench was built in order to validate the PPC concept, the control performance and the improvement of the conversion efficiency. The experimental results corroborate the benefits of using a PPC, in terms of increasing the system efficiency by reducing the processed power of the converter, while not affecting the system performance.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel hybrid distribution transformer integrated with photovoltaic (HDT--PV) including a three-phase four-leg inverter, as a promising electrical device applied in the unbalanced active distribution network (ADN). The HDT--PV has the ability to access distributed PV system, balance three-phase power and provide reactive power compensation. In order to take advantage of these capabilities of the HDT--PV, collaborative optimization control strategy of HDT--PVs in the unbalanced ADN is presented. The optimization aims at minimizing network power losses and improving voltage profiles of the entire ADN. To do so, the HDT--PV's model in the case of unequal three-phase loads is established, and the corresponding simulation is conducted to verify the correctness of the model. Finally, case studies of collaborative optimization control of HDT--PVs are carried out in various scenarios using the modified unbalanced IEEE 33-bus system. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed collaborative control scheme on reducing network power losses and suppressing three-phase voltage unbalance.},

Besides, the lack of inertia caused by droop and phase-locked loop-based current control brings negative effects to the system. In this article, we propose a distributed normalized power coordination (NPC) embedded with virtual synchronous generator for hybrid microgrid. The proposed NPC controller can achieve cross inertia support, accurate global power sharing, and frequency/voltage recovery among dispatchable DGs simultaneously. Furthermore, to suppress frequency and power oscillation, the index of inertia deviation is proposed to guide the inertia placement of hybrid MG based on Participation Factor analysis. Finally, the proposed strategy is validated by the simulation and hardware-in-loop tests compared to the conventional methods.},

HDT-PVs, regarded as promising devices with high reliability and easy engineering in ADNs, can not only realize the on-site maximum utilization of distributed solar energy but also solve the various power quality problems that follow. Moreover, the reactive power flow in the ADN can be optimized through remote cooperative control of multiple HDT-PVs. In this situation, the two objectives of voltage regulation and network power loss decrease are achieved in the ADN. If the power electronic device in the HDT-PV fails, the HDT-PV is able to work as a conventional distribution transformer by cutting off all power electronic devices and PV systems. Even when a small number of HDT-PVs malfunction, the system can still run stably. Finally, the simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

The advanced ICM for hybrid ac/dc/ds microgrids involves the nine-switch topology with compact configuration and decreased number of active operating switches, which structurally equivalents to afford a dc interconnection port for dc subgrid, an ac interconnection port for ac subgrid, a ds interconnection port for ds subgrid, and two dc--dc converters for the interconnection ports for parallel DSs. In addition to the popular advantage of component elements saving, the suggested ICM, aggregating various interlinking converter cells (ICCs) into an ICM, is also proficient of participating computations from all ICC sensors to enhance the overall modular performance without building extra communication connection links between ICCs. With this in mind, a decentralized power management control strategy is realized by employing a coordination power control methodology to systematically handle various distributed generations (DGs), DSs, and ICM in a decentralized manner with improved communication fault ride-through capability.

Integrating energy storage units (ESUs) to address the intermittent nature of renewables in DCMGs has become an enhanced requirement for these converters. This article proposes a partially rated multiport interlinking converter (PMIC) that incorporates a distributed ESU. The PMIC controls a floating voltage and a bidirectional shunt current on the dc line, ensuring full galvanic isolation for the ESU while operating at a low dc-link voltage. It regulates multidirectional power flow and balances power during peak and off-peak periods. A decentralized droop-based power flow control strategy is proposed for the PMIC, which distributes renewable energy generation, load consumption, and ESU utilization proportionally across the system. The control strategy includes two tailored continuously differentiable activation functions, Sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent, to facilitate autonomous global power-sharing and seamless ESU engagement. Simulation and experimental case studies confirm the PMIC's capability to smooth renewable energy fluctuations and enhance the power and voltage profiles of DCMGs.},

  abstract = {This paper is mainly focused on the stability-related issues of a grid-tied interlinking converter system. First, hybrid AC/DC admittance characteristics of an interlinking converter operating under unity and non-unity power factors are analyzed separately. Then, by using the hybrid AC/DC admittance and determinant-based General Nyquist Criterion (GNC), the stability assessment, instability root cause identification, and instability mitigation of a grid-tied interlinking converter system are studied. In addition, decoupled mitigation of the AC- and DC-side instabilities are discussed based on the hybrid AC/DC admittance characteristics. The study results show that when an interlinking converter operates under unity power factor, the stabilities of the AC and DC sides are decoupled and can be regulated independently. To be more specific, the DC-side stability is subjected to the d-axis admittance, DC admittance, and their coupling admittances while the AC-side stability is dominated by the q-axis admittance. According to the hybrid AC/DC admittance characteristics, this paper further reveals that the DC-side stability is determined by the d-axis controllers. In contrast, the AC-side stability is governed by the q-axis controllers and the phase-locked loop (PLL). Finally, the analysis presented in this paper is verified based on frequencyand time-domain simulations in the Matlab/Simulink environment.},

In this article, a unified impedance model, suitable for either inverter current control (ICC) or grid current control (GCC) of LCL-type grid-connected inverters with observer-based capacitor current feedback active damping, is built to facilitate the passivity-based stability assessment and controller parameter design. With the passivity analysis, it is found that when the antiresonant frequency of LCL filter is in certain ranges, i.e., (0.056{\o}mega \_s, 0.20{\o}mega \_s) for ICC and (0.046{\o}mega \_s, 0.23{\o}mega \_s) for GCC, all frequencies' passive output admittance of the inverter can be achieved via proposed parameter design guidelines. Due to the utilization of the observer and all frequencies' passive output admittance property, not only extra current sensors for active damping can be saved, but also the inverter can be connected and stably operated in a grid regardless of the grid impedance. The validity of the theoretical analysis and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by using experimental results on a laboratory prototype.},

  abstract = {Distribution transformers play a pivotal role as an isolation stage between varying voltage levels. However, with the increasing demands of distribution generations, the conventional low-frequency transformer (LFT) faces challenges in maintaining qualified voltage levels. In response, a hybrid distribution transformer (HDT), integrating an LFT and a power converter, emerges as an optimal solution. One crucial concern when employing a converter is the magnetizing inrush current of LFT. In this paper, an HDT topology without auxiliary transformer winding is proposed in a single phase, featuring a converter connected in series on the primary side and a converter connected in parallel on the secondary side. This configuration provides adjustment capability to address voltage irregularities. This paper delves into the working principle for the HDT, with a specific focus on the magnetizing inrush current considering line voltage variation.

  abstract = {For the problem of control of flexible linear double inverted pendulum (FLDIP), considering that the method of obtaining LQR parameters through traditional manual trial-and-error is too cumbersome, and the basic particle swarm optimization algorithm has a slower convergence speed and is prone to a local optimal solution, in this paper, a control method is proposed that it can achieve autonomous optimization based on improved the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Firstly, the mathematical model of the FLDIPs is given to analyse the stability of the system. Then, the PSO algorithm is improved from the perspective of dynamically adjusting inertia weights to optimize linear quadratic regulator (LQR) parameters. Finally, through simulation comparison with the LQR control effect obtained by the manual trial and error method, the feasibility of the improved PSO algorithm is verified. This method can not only improve the control performance of the system but also effectively overcome the problem of blindness in selecting Q for traditional LQR optimal control.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an analytical methodology to evaluate the power processed by dc-dc converters operating as series voltage regulators, which provide an alternative to increase efficiency in photovoltaic systems. Via the analysis of both active and nonactive power processing, the proposed methodology allows to clearly distinguish among circuit topologies as truly partial-power processing (PPP) or just partial active power processing topologies. When an isolated dc-dc topology is connected in series as a voltage regulator, the overall processed power can be reduced, which reduces power losses and improves efficiency. Conversely, this paper also demonstrates that some series-regulator topologies may not actually reduce the proportion of nonactive processed power. To demonstrate the applications of the proposed methodology and to emphasize its significance, two well-known series-connected voltage regulators (flyback and full-bridge phase shift) and a full-power regulator (boost) were evaluated. The results indicate that the full-bridge series regulator can perform a true PPP, whereas the flyback series-regulator processes the same amount of power as that processed by conventional nonisolated boost converters and cannot be considered a partial-power topology. This study finding contradicts assertions in the literature that this topology achieves high-efficiency dc-dc conversion through PPP. To confirm the theoretical analysis, experimental results from three 750-W prototypes are presented alongside its simulations.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to reduce the power processed by series-connected partial-power converters (S-PPC) applied to string/multistring level maximum power point tracking photovoltaic systems. A design procedure based on the definition of the voltage regulation range is presented. It introduces an additional degree of freedom that allows a proper design of the converter in order to reduce not only the active power but also the nonactive power, reducing losses and increasing power density. By means of the proposed approach, it is also demonstrated that by replacing the conventional step-up partial-power converter by a step-up/down partial-power converter, the active and nonactive power can be further reduced, allowing to better explore the benefits of the partial-power concept. In order to validate the proposed approach, two 750-W prototypes of full-bridge S-PPC and full-bridge/push-pull S-PPC were implemented and experimentally evaluated. The step-up/down prototype presented a reduction of 46.9\% in nonactive power and 23.4\% of its volume, resulting in a higher efficiency and power density in comparison to the voltage step-up prototype counterpart.},

Synchronous frame regulators are generally accepted to have a better performance than stationary frame regulators, as they operate on DC quantities and hence can eliminate steady-state errors. This paper establishes a theoretical connection between these two classes of regulators and proposes a new type of stationary frame regulator, the P+Resonant regulator, which achieves the same transient and steady-state performance as a synchronous frame PI regulator. The new regulator is applicable to both single-phase and three phase inverters.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a new scheme based on state feedback control concept is presented for robust control of bidirectional interlink power converters (BILPCs) in hybrid microgrids (HMGs). The studied grid-connected HMG contains one dc and one ac microgrid, interconnected by BILPCs. To consider uncertainties, the nonlinear uncertain model of the BILPC is derived and linearized based on Lie derivative concept. As a new point of view for dynamic modeling of BILPC, it is indicated that each nonlinear uncertain BILPC model can be represented by two decoupled subsystems. Then, a virtual robust state feedback controller is designed to independently control each of these subsystems with disturbance rejection capability. The gains of the state feedback controllers are obtained using Ackerman pole placement method. To approximate the unknown inputs/unmodeled dynamics, which are needed in the design process of the state feedback controllers, a high-gain proportional-integral (PI) observer is designed. The high gains of this PI observer are determined using linear quadratic regulation method. Simulation results and comparative studies support the efficacy of the proposed control approach.},

  abstract = {Power systems with large shares of converter-interfaced renewables may be characterized by low grid inertia due to the lack of frequency containment provided by synchronous generators. Battery energy storage systems (BESSs), which can adjust their power output at much steeper ramping than conventional generation, are promising assets to restore suitable frequency regulation capacity levels. BESSs are typically connected to the grid with a power converter, which can be operated in either grid-forming or grid-following modes. This paper quantitatively assesses the impact of large-scale BESSs on the frequency containment of low inertia power grid and compares the performance of grid-forming and grid-following control modes. Numerical results are provided considering a detailed dynamic model of the IEEE 39-bus system where fully characterized models of stochastic demand and generation are taken into account. In order to assess the performance of the BESS control modes in a practical operative context, daily long simulations are considered where reserve levels for frequency containment and restoration are allocated considering the current practice of a transmission system operator in Europe. Numerical analyses on various metrics applied to grid frequency show that grid-forming outperforms grid-following converter control mode.},
