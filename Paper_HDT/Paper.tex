\begin{abstract}
    This paper presents a unified state-feedback control strategy for a hybrid distribution transformer (HDT) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) for tuning the control gains. The proposed control strategy aims to achieve zero steady-state error for sinusoidal references and disturbances while ensuring good dynamic performance. An augmented state-space model of the HDT is developed, incorporating delays from the digital control system and resonant states to ensure zero steady-state error. The control gains are optimized using PSO to minimize a cost function that considers both transient and steady-state performance. Simulation results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in regulating the voltage and current of the HDT under various operating conditions.
