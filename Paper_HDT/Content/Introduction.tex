\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} increasing penetration of renewable energy sources= in the electrical grid has led to a significant rise in the use of power electronic converters. These converters are essential for integrating RES into the grid, as they facilitate the conversion of DC power generated by sources like solar panels and wind turbines into AC power compatible with the grid. However, the widespread use of power electronic converters has also introduced challenges related to power quality, such as the injection of harmonics and non-linear loads, which can lead to voltage distortions and other issues in the electrical grid.



One of the advantages of the HDT is its ability to compensate grid voltage disturbances, such as sags and swells, and to compensate the load current harmonics, in case of unbalanced loads. Moreover, since the HDT uses the DT, it provides galvanic isolation between primary and secondary sides and higher short-circuit current capability \cite{carrenoCirculatingActivePower2023}.
