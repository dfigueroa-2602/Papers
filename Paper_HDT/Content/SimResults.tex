In this section, the simulation results of the proposed control strategy are presented. The simulations are performed using MATLAB/Simulink, and the system parameters are listed in Table \ref{tab:params}. The proposed control strategy is tested under grid unbalanced swell, load impact, load unbalance, and non-linear load conditions.

Each of the load impacts are comprised by $47\ \Omega$ resistive load per phase, $2\ k\Omega$ resistive load in phase $a$ for the unbalanced load, and a three-phase diode bridge rectifier with a $47\ \Omega$ resistive load at its output for the non-linear load. The simulation results are shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.

\subsection{Grid Voltage Unbalanced Swell Compensation}

From the instant $t = 10\ ms$ until $t = 260\ ms$, a three-phase unbalanced swell of $10\%$ the nominal value, in phase $b$ is applied to the grid voltage, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(a). The proposed control strategy effectively compensates for the unbalanced swell, meaning that the parallel inverter injects the necessary voltage to maintain a balanced transformer secondary side current, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(d).

\subsection{Load Impact}

At $t = 60\ ms$, a three-phase balanced load impact of $47\ \Omega$ per phase is applied, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(b). In this case, the parallel converter injects the necessary current to maintain the transformer secondary side current, in particular after the load impact, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(e).

\subsection{Unbalanced Load Compensation}

Following the load impacts, at $t = 100\ ms$ an unbalanced load is applied, where phase $a$ has a load of $2\ k\Omega$ and phases $b$ and $c$ have a load of $47\ \Omega$, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(f). The parallel converter injects the necessary current to maintain a balanced transformer secondary side current, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(e).

\subsection{Non-linear Load Compensation}

At $t = 140\ ms$, a three-phase diode bridge rectifier with a $47\ \Omega$ resistive load at its output is applied, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(f). In this case, the parallel converter reference is mainly composed by the fundamental component of the load current, which is extracted using a notch filter. The proposed control strategy manages to compensate this disturbance, maintaining the transformer secondary side current sinusoidal and balanced, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(d).

\subsection{Third Harmonic Compensation}
Finally, at $t = 200\ ms$, a third harmonic component is added to the grid voltage, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(a). In this case, the series converter reference is mainly composed by the fundamental and third harmonic components of the grid voltage, which are extracted using a notch filter. The proposed control strategy effectively compensates for this disturbance, maintaining the transformer secondary side current sinusoidal and balanced, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(d).
