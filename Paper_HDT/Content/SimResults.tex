In this section, the simulation results of the proposed control strategy are presented. The simulations are performed using MATLAB/Simulink, and the system parameters are listed in Table \ref{tab:params}. The proposed control strategy is tested under various grid and load disturbances, including grid voltage unbalanced swell, load impact, and unbalanced load.

\subsection{Grid Voltage Unbalanced Swell Compensation}

The simulation results for the proposed control strategy under grid voltage unbalanced swell are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:sim1}. The grid voltage swell occurs at $t=0.02\ s$ and lasts for $0.08\ s$. The proposed control strategy effectively compensates for the voltage swell, maintaining a balanced load current.

\subsection{Load Impact and Unbalanced Load Compensation}

In the other hand, a load unbalance is applied at $t=0.1\ s$ and lasts for $0.06\ s$. Then, an unbalanced load is applied at $t=0.16\ s$ and lasts for $0.06\ s$. The proposed control strategy effectively compensates for the load unbalance, meaning that the parallel inverter injects the necessary current to maintain a balanced load current, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:sim2}.
