In this section, the simulation results of the proposed control strategy are presented. The simulations are performed using MATLAB/Simulink, and the system parameters are listed in Table \ref{tab:params}. The proposed control strategy is tested under grid unbalanced swell, load impact, load unbalance, and non-linear load conditions.

\subsection{Grid Voltage Unbalanced Swell Compensation}

From the instant $t = 20\ ms$ until $t = 220\ ms$, a three-phase unbalanced swell of $10\%$ the nominal value, in phase $b$ is applied to the grid voltage, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(a). The nominal balanced resistive load of $47\ \Omega$ is connected to the HDT. The proposed control strategy effectively compensates for the unbalanced swell, meaning that the parallel inverter injects the necessary voltage to maintain a balanced transformer secondary side current, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(d).

\subsection{Load Impact}

At $t = 60\ ms$, a three-phase balanced load impact of $47\ \Omega$ per phase is applied, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(b). In this case, the parallel converter supplies the needed current to provide additional power so the DC-link voltage will be balanced.

\subsection{Unbalanced Load Compensation}

Following the load impacts, at $t = 100\ ms$ an unbalanced load of $94\ \Omega$ between $b$ and $c$ is connected in parallel to the existing loads. The parallel converter injects the necessary current to maintain a balanced transformer secondary side current, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(e). Therefore, the control strategy manages to keep $i_Y$ with balanced magnitudes, as is obtained in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(f)

\subsection{Non-linear Load Compensation}

At $t = 140\ ms$, a three-phase diode bridge rectifier with a $47\ \Omega$ resistive load at its output is applied, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(f). In this case, additionally to the existing DC-link control, the reference is calculated by the actuation of the harmonics compensation control loop, which compensates the harmonics that the non-linear load injects to the secondary side, which can be seen in the \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(f). The proposed control strategy manages to compensate this disturbance, maintaining the transformer secondary side current sinusoidal and balanced, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(d).

\subsection{Grid Voltage 3rd Harmonic Distortion}
Finally, at $t = 180\ ms$, a third harmonic component is added to the grid voltage, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(a). In this case, the series converter reference is composed by the grid voltage harmonics plus the existing voltage swell compensation, as illustrated in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(b). The proposed control strategy effectively compensates for this disturbance, maintaining a clean transformer secondary side current sinusoidal and balanced, as shown in \Cref{fig:Sim_results}.(d).
