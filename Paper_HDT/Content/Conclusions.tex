In the present paper a unified state-feedback control strategy for a HDT was proposed. The control strategy was designed using an augmented state-space model of the HDT that includes the delays introduced by the digital control system and resonant states to achieve zero steady-state error for sinusoidal references. The control gains were optimized using PSO to minimize a cost function that considers both the transient and steady-state performance of the HDT. This enables optimal weight selection during the state-feedback controller tuning instead of relying on heuristic or trial-and-error tuning.

The proposed control strategy was validated through simulation results that demonstrated its effectiveness in regulating the voltage and current of the HDT under various operating conditions, including grid voltage unbalanced swell compensation, load impact and unbalanced load compensation, non-linear load compensation, and grid harmonics compensation.
